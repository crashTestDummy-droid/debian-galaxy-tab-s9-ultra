# Galaxy CPU/GPU frequencies and efficiency

For the subsequent ambient-brightness and D-Bus audit with Chrome/ChatGPT open,
see [office-use efficiency, 2026-09-09](office-efficiency-20260909.md).

For the post-kernel-#8 sensor audit, four-camera baseline and staged GPU ISP
experiment, see [camera/sensor efficiency](camera-sensor-efficiency.md).

The SM-X910 uses Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy (SM8550-AC). Its CPU targets are
2.016 GHz for CPUs 0–2, 2.8032 GHz for CPUs 3–6, and 3.36 GHz for CPU 7. The
Adreno 740 target is 719 MHz. These are factory operating points, with normal
thermal/current limits; they are not frequencies to force continuously.

## Evidence and cause

The physical pre-change kernel on 2026-09-08 exposed:

| Resource | Available maximum | Factory target |
|---|---:|---:|
| CPU 0–2, Cortex-A510 | 2.016 GHz | 2.016 GHz |
| CPU 3–4, Cortex-A710 | 2.8032 GHz | 2.8032 GHz |
| CPU 5–6, Cortex-A715 | 2.8032 GHz | 2.8032 GHz |
| CPU 7, Cortex-X3 | 2.9568 GHz | 3.36 GHz |
| Adreno 740 | 680 MHz | 719 MHz |

The seven lower CPUs reached their respective policy maximum in individual
affinity-pinned CPU tests. CPU 7 topped out at 2.9568 GHz. Under simultaneous
all-core load, the intermediate cluster sometimes reported 2.7072 GHz even
with 2.8032 GHz requested. Thermal/current throttling must remain operational.

`dmesg` reported `cpu cpu7: Voltage update failed freq=3360000`. This is a
missing OPP description: `qcom-cpufreq-hw` reads the firmware's frequency and
voltage LUT, disables the DT OPPs, and re-enables only matching entries. The
reference `sm8550.dtsi` lacks 3.36 GHz. Its 3.1872 GHz node does not describe
the firmware's last boost entry, so the usable maximum falls to 2.9568 GHz.
The board addition supplies the existing top-end LLCC/DDR/L3 bandwidth votes;
the CPU voltage and boost classification still come from the hardware LUT.

Samsung's locally extracted X910 stock `vendor_boot` DTB, SHA-256
`40b5cb5e7b1d0f3c2378559cec462fa391fb8352ae6a05744505e8acad4d8ead`,
describes GPU bin 0 at 719,000,000 Hz with RPMh level 224 (SVS_L2), DDR table
entry 9 (16,500,000 kB/s) and ACD `0x882e5ffd`. The port uses those values.
Do not substitute the ACD values from another Qualcomm board's generic table.
The existing lower GPU OPPs remain available.

[Samsung's specifications](https://www.samsung.com/za/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-5g-graphite-256gb-sm-x916bzaaafa/)
list the marketed CPU speeds as 3.36/2.8/2 GHz.
[Qualcomm's launch announcement](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/07/snapdragon-powers-samsung-s-new-galaxy-lineup-globally)
confirms the Galaxy-specific processor and accelerated GPU in the Tab S9.
The exact GPU electrical parameters above come from this device's stock DT.

## Bootloader-compatible implementation

The release build intentionally pins its ABL-facing base DTB to the previously
validated fingerprint baseline. Editing the board DTS alone does not change
that build. An additional physical check confirmed that changing only the DTB
appended to `boot` leaves the live DT unchanged: ABL uses `vendor_boot` here.
The appended-only test was rolled back to the original boot image.

`kernel/dts/gts9u-performance.dtso` adds only the two OPP nodes.
`scripts/stage-performance-overlay.sh` embeds it in a small built-in board
helper. Its `core_initcall` applies the overlay to Linux's live tree, after
OF initialization and before cpufreq and DRM can consume their OPP tables.
It runs only for `samsung,gts9uwifi`. No firmware RPC, memory ownership change,
Gunyah hook, reserved-memory modification or bootloader DT replacement occurs.
The full board DTS also records the OPPs for a future unpinned build.

The overlay application is transactional and the overlay remains for the boot
lifetime. `CONFIG_OF_OVERLAY=y` is already required by the port's Gunyah
integration. It must be built in; loading this helper after the GPU/cpufreq
drivers probe would be too late.

Two cpufreq fixes are also needed in this kernel:

- `arm-topology-use-boost-frequency-reference.patch` derives the scheduler's
  frequency reference from the complete valid frequency table. At policy
  creation boost is disabled; caching the non-boost maximum left `schedutil`
  unable to request 3.36 GHz even after userspace enabled it. Dynamic scaling
  and policy/QoS limits still apply.
- `cpufreq-recompute-software-boost-limit.patch` recalculates the software
  boost maximum on every transition. Linux 7.2-rc3's table helper preserves
  a pre-existing higher `cpuinfo.max_freq`; without resetting it in the
  software boost handler, disabling boost changed both sysfs flags to zero
  but left the effective maximum at 3.36 GHz. The error path restores the
  previous maximum. This fixes actual Power Saver behavior.

## Desktop policy and efficiency

`ubuntu-gts9u-cpu-boost.service` connects the generic cpufreq boost control to
Ubuntu 24.04's existing Power Profiles daemon:

- **Balanced / Performance:** the firmware boost OPP can be selected.
- **Power Saver:** CPU boost is disabled.
- **Older kernels without the 3.36 GHz boost OPP:** it exits successfully
  without writing any frequency control.

The helper listens for D-Bus changes; it has no periodic polling. A missing or
temporarily unavailable profile property preserves the last selection. With
no Power Profiles daemon owner at startup it defaults to Balanced and watches
for the daemon to appear. An explicit service stop restores its initial boost
setting if nobody has changed that setting since its last update.

This only changes the boost switch. CPU governors stay `schedutil`, GPU stays
`simple_ondemand`, all low-frequency OPPs and CPU idle states remain present,
and cooling devices keep their limits. GPU boost is part of its OPP table and
is not controlled by the CPU boost switch.

The baseline audit also found working energy-aware scheduling, deep CPU idle,
8 GiB of compressed zram ahead of disk swap, and dynamic UFS frequency scaling.
During a 15-second idle sample, total CPU busy time was 3.15% and every core's
deep-idle residency counter advanced. The earlier camera-relay idle fixes are
already installed. There is no evidence here for changing their behavior,
forcing minimum clocks, disabling idle, or altering storage power management.
Battery current while charging measures charge flow, not system power; these
tests do not establish an energy-per-task or battery-life improvement.

## Reproduce the checks

### Office-use background work, 2026-09-08

The subsequent [Chromium driver-identity correction](chromium-freedreno-identity.md)
removes a global vendor override that caused missing text and repeated Skia
shader failures. It preserves GPU acceleration; active applications must be
reopened before post-change office-use metrics are meaningful.

The owner continued office work with Chrome and ChatGPT during this audit.
Measurements are active-use samples, not idle battery-life benchmarks. The
display brightness, refresh rate, power profile, CPU/GPU limits, networking,
sensor sampling and memory configuration were not changed.

Two narrowly scoped userspace changes were validated:

- `v4l2-relayd-gts9u 0.1.2-gts9u16` stops its splash producer when no V4L2
  client is streaming. The output pipeline stays open, so all four devices
  still advertise CAPTURE. Existing 250 ms open/500 ms close debouncing,
  shared-ISP locking and camera handover remain in place. A waiting or
  preempted reader still receives paced black frames. Restarting the splash
  resets its clock origin to avoid a burst of stale frames after a long gap.
- The fingerprint availability broker's 250 ms timer now only checks its
  local two-second lease deadline. It no longer queries logind every tick.
  Each Pulse still checks the caller UID and current session properties.
  Trusted logind property changes, session removal and daemon/client loss
  trigger revalidation or revocation. The secure transport, authentication
  result handling, panel controls and GNOME extension are unchanged.

The sensors were inspected but not retuned: the accelerometer remained
available with orientation `normal`. Reducing its sampling rate without
orientation-latency testing would not meet the requirement to preserve the
desktop experience. The build still selects `softisp-gpu=disabled`; moving
image processing to GPU is a separate project requiring image-quality,
latency and energy validation. This change reduces unused camera work only.

Twenty-second cgroup CPU-time samples with no camera readers gave:

| Service | Original, % of one CPU | Candidate, % of one CPU |
|---|---:|---:|
| Four camera relays and supervisor | 6.984 | 0.348 |
| Fingerprint availability broker | 1.572 | 0.766 |

These short sequential samples show lower background CPU work, not a measured
battery-life gain. Chrome/ChatGPT activity and repeated graphics-error logging
varied during the samples; total battery-power samples were not comparable.
One intermediate measurement overlapped camera testing and was excluded from
the table. The camera supervisor still checks child/PipeWire liveness once a
second; its recovery behavior was retained.

Validation included compilation with `-Wall -Werror`, a synthetic GStreamer
test of priming/no-reader idle/paced reopening/preemption/delayed closing,
17 fingerprint policy/lifecycle tests, and the existing fingerprint startup,
overlay, visual-state, keyboard and recovery tests. A live invalid-session
Pulse was rejected and the desktop's legitimate lease continued renewing.
No end-to-end biometric login or cold reboot was performed in this audit.

All four physical cameras retained their labels and produced changing frames
through read-mode V4L2 capture. The final runs observed 45, 43, 46 and 45
distinct sampled-luminance hashes respectively; no images were stored. The
first camera also reopened successfully after cycling all four. An initial
automatic-I/O GStreamer probe returned a single black frame with **both**
the candidate and restored original binary, so that probe was not treated as
evidence of a new regression. The successful probe used `io-mode=rw`, paced
consumption and allowed the existing debounce to complete. Chrome/OBS UI
camera-switching and concurrent-client behavior were not revalidated live;
the synthetic test covers the relay's preempted-reader splash state.

Only `/usr/bin/v4l2-relayd` and
`/usr/libexec/ubuntu-gts9u-fingerprint-ui` were replaced on the tablet and
their two services restarted. No system reboot was needed. The live files
were staged directly for validation; dpkg package versions were not changed.
The repository build integrates the changes as relay gts9u16/device 2.48.
Both services remain enabled. The five-minute rollback timer was stopped
after validation. Original files and a recovery script are in:

```text
/var/lib/gts9u-efficiency-backups/session-Q9e30BY6/
```

Recovery (restores the two original files and restarts only their services):

```sh
sudo bash /var/lib/gts9u-efficiency-backups/session-Q9e30BY6/transaction.sh \
  rollback /var/lib/gts9u-efficiency-backups/session-Q9e30BY6
```

SHA-256 of the installed candidates:

```text
9a77b4c889c3a4f84300dfa8c69642b5853d7fa2b0942f55feba58fe0b4b0b93  v4l2-relayd
dfe93f144a75155b8092de565be8f5e8a2da775a7828ee7a77db3ba224fd195a  ubuntu-gts9u-fingerprint-ui
```

To reproduce the synthetic relay test with GStreamer development libraries
and the patched relay source (it does not access physical cameras):

```sh
cc -O2 -Wall -Werror -DRELAY_SOURCE='"/absolute/path/src/v4l2-relayd.c"' \
  -DG_LOG_DOMAIN='"v4l2_relayd"' -DV4L2_RELAYD_VERSION='"test"' \
  scripts/test-relay-idle.c -o /tmp/test-relay-idle \
  $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gio-unix-2.0 gstreamer-app-1.0 gstreamer-video-1.0)
/tmp/test-relay-idle
python3 scripts/test-fingerprint-ui.py
```

### CPU and GPU checks

On the build host, using a known-good base DTB:

```sh
bash scripts/test-performance-overlay.sh /path/to/validated-base.dtb
```

This checks OPP properties, repeat application and staging, and that every
other node/property is unchanged. No device is written by that test.

On the tablet:

```sh
python3 scripts/gts9u-frequency-audit.py
python3 scripts/gts9u-frequency-audit.py --exercise --seconds 1.5 --require-galaxy-max
python3 scripts/gts9u-frequency-audit.py --exercise --seconds 2 --workload burst --require-observed-max
powerprofilesctl set power-saver
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost
powerprofilesctl set balanced
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost
```

The audit is read-only unless `--exercise` is explicitly requested; exercise
adds bounded SHA-256 CPU workloads without writing sysfs. It pins each core,
then exercises all eight, sampling requested and hardware-reported policy
frequencies and temperatures. It cools between runs, stops at 75 C by default,
and cleans up its workers. `--require-galaxy-max` checks that the target OPPs
are registered and allowed. For the stricter, workload-dependent requirement
that every core reports its target in its own run, add `--require-observed-max`.
That check may fail legitimately under hardware thermal/current limiting,
even when the requested clock and permitted maximum are correct.
`--workload burst` alternates 12 ms of SHA-256 with 3 ms of idle. During
individual-core tests the observer runs on another core and restores its
original affinity afterwards; sampling on the tested core can fill its idle
gaps and change the result.
The readings are cpufreq policy telemetry, not independent clock metrology.

### Interpreting fastfetch after a restart

`fastfetch` reports the maximum currently allowed by cpufreq, not every boost
OPP registered in the policy. Power Profiles daemon persists the selected
profile across restarts. Consequently, when the tablet starts in Power Saver,
the profile bridge correctly disables CPU boost and `fastfetch` reports about
2.96 GHz; this alone is not evidence that the 3.36 GHz OPP or the new kernel
has disappeared. Check `scaling_boost_frequencies`, the global `boost` switch,
`cpuinfo_max_freq`, `scaling_max_freq` and `powerprofilesctl get` together.

When a validated kernel was written directly to the active `boot` partition,
also refresh the Ubuntu image used by the dual-boot switch. Otherwise a later
Android → Ubuntu switch can restore the older kernel even though ordinary
restarts keep the validated one. The refresh helper refuses to proceed unless
the candidate and active partition have the same caller-supplied SHA-256, and
it backs up both the active and previously saved images before replacing only
the saved `boot.img`:

```sh
pkexec scripts/refresh-saved-ubuntu-boot.sh \
  /path/to/validated-boot.img EXPECTED_SHA256 --apply
```

Identify the partition by GPT label and size before running the helper. It
does not write the active partition, `vendor_boot`, `init_boot`, `dtbo`,
modules, firmware or any Android data. Its printed backup directory contains
the previous saved image for recovery.

### Post-restart persistence audit, 2026-09-08

The first restart after the physical validation still ran
`7.2.0-rc3-dirty` build **#7**, built `Tue Sep 8 04:20:00 CEST 2026`. Power
Profiles daemon had persisted Power Saver, and the enabled profile bridge's
boot log showed `CPU boost=0, power profile=power-saver`. The live prime policy
still registered `3360000` as its boost frequency, while its allowed maximum
was correctly limited to 2,956,800 kHz. The GPU still exposed 719 MHz. Thus
fastfetch's 2.96 GHz was the selected power policy, not a kernel regression.

A Balanced → Power Saver → Balanced transition produced, respectively,
boost/max pairs `1/3360000`, `0/2956800`, and `1/3360000` kHz. The CPU governor
remained `schedutil`, the GPU governor remained `simple_ondemand`, and a final
read-only `--require-galaxy-max` audit passed. In Balanced, fastfetch reported
3.36 GHz again. An exercise attempt made while the tablet was already warm
aborted before starting workers because it did not cool below 50 C in 30
seconds; no thermal limit was relaxed and no worker remained.

The GPT metadata identified `/dev/sda21` as Samsung UFS partition `boot`, size
100,663,296 bytes. The active partition matched the validated build #7 image:

```text
33643c8c9c4d26da8988d133b1c3b5af8e3999f02cd3e0d40e7fbf12bdfaf811
```

The dual-boot Ubuntu copy still had the older hash
`c6dad49b175b8bd9e7b6a7607edd65b51038ba4b6de77856b0202708fd507b8f`.
Before synchronization, Tab Companion consequently identified the active set
as `null`: the active kernel did not match the saved Ubuntu set. The helper
above verified the active and candidate hashes, backed up both boot images,
and replaced only `/var/lib/gts9u-boot-sets/ubuntu/boot.img`. It did not write
any partition. The saved Ubuntu image now has the validated hash, and Tab
Companion identifies the complete active set as `ubuntu`.

The previous saved image is recoverable from:

```text
/var/lib/gts9u-kernel-backups/pre-saved-ubuntu-boot-sync-wjaFznJJ/saved-ubuntu-boot.img
```

No QEMU, libvirt, crosvm or Gunyah VM process was active during the audit.
`/dev/gunyah` remained present, which is recorded only as a health check and
not as proof that every virtualization feature works.

For an off-screen GPU workload in an existing Wayland session:

```sh
glmark2-es2-wayland --off-screen --size 1920x1080 \
  -b shading:shading=phong:duration=6.0 -b terrain:duration=6.0
```

Sample `/sys/class/devfreq/3d00000.gpu/cur_freq` concurrently. The baseline
reached 680 MHz, with 2,425 FPS in `shading` and 193 FPS in `terrain`, using
Mesa 25.2.8. Those scene results are not a whole-system performance score.

## Physical validation, 2026-09-08

The candidate was built from an independent copy of the active Gunyah
runtime9 source and object tree. Its kernel release remains
`7.2.0-rc3-dirty`, with the identical config and module signing certificate.
Both Gunyah source directories compare byte-for-byte with the original.
The installed modules, `vendor_boot`, `init_boot`, firmware and saved dual-boot
Ubuntu image were not replaced. `/dev/gunyah`, fingerprint device `/dev/esfp0`,
NetworkManager and GDM remained available after the test boots.

The original active boot image is backed up at
`/var/lib/gts9u-kernel-backups/pre-galaxy-frequencies-20260908/boot.img`,
SHA-256 `c0f3d7bd8066acb688ea0bb6224b90d011b71a5bf64fe36edd1394d5aa4ee23a`.
Test images used a five-minute automatic rollback guard until host health
was verified. The guard is disabled after successful validation.

The final running image is kernel build **#7**, boot partition SHA-256
`33643c8c9c4d26da8988d133b1c3b5af8e3999f02cd3e0d40e7fbf12bdfaf811`.
The full per-core burst audit passed with `--require-observed-max`. A separate
continuous SHA-256 audit also observed each target during its own core's run:

| Individually exercised cores | Requested and reported peak |
|---|---:|
| 0, 1, 2 | 2.016 GHz each |
| 3, 4, 5, 6 | 2.8032 GHz each |
| 7 | 3.36 GHz |

With all eight cores loaded together, the intermediate cluster reported
2.7072 GHz and the prime core 2.9568 GHz, despite higher requested clocks.
The maximum sensor reading was 68.6 C in the burst audit and 74.2 C in the
continuous audit. These limits are preserved; peak frequency availability
does not imply that all cores can sustain their maximum simultaneously.

Live profile tests verified Balanced → Power Saver → Balanced, restarting
Power Profiles while in Power Saver, and restarting the bridge in Balanced.
Power Saver produced boost=0 and a 2.9568 GHz prime limit; Balanced produced
boost=1 and a 3.36 GHz limit. The governors remained unchanged throughout.

In a same-boot GPU comparison with the same GDM Wayland compositor, governor,
Mesa version and 1920x1080 off-screen scenes, the cap was changed in ABBA
order and restored afterwards. Each run started below 45 C:

| GPU cap | Shading FPS | Terrain FPS | Observed peak | Peak SoC sensor |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 680 MHz, A | 2758 | 200 | 680 MHz | 54.5 C |
| 719 MHz, A | 2980 | 217 | 719 MHz | 64.3 C |
| 719 MHz, B | 2880 | 204 | 719 MHz | 58.1 C |
| 680 MHz, B | 2652 | 199 | 680 MHz | 57.7 C |

This ABBA comparison used build #6, before the final software-boost-disable
fix; its GPU code and OPPs are identical to build #7.
Both 719 MHz runs improved these scenes, with meaningful run-to-run variation.
This is a short validation of the usable GPU OPP, not a battery-life test or
a general application performance guarantee. The earlier baseline used a
different desktop session and is not a controlled comparison with these runs.

After the CPU audits, a longer GPU validation on build #7 reached 719 MHz
but was stopped by the test's 75 C guard (76.1 C at the sampled crossing).
The test terminated its render process. No thermal thresholds or cooling
devices were disabled to make the benchmark finish.

After cooling, a final build #7 run completed both scenes at three seconds
each, reached 719 MHz and peaked at 54.5 C (3232/212 FPS). Its shorter duration
makes it unsuitable for comparison with the six-second ABBA results.
The final 15-second idle sample showed 3.14% total CPU busy time and advancing
deep-idle counters on all eight cores. The profile bridge had consumed 52 ms
of CPU time and about 9 MB of memory. These checks confirm that idle and
dynamic scaling still work; they do not measure battery-life gains.

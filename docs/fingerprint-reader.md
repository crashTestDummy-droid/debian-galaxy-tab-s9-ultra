# The EL721 fingerprint reader under Ubuntu

## Current status: working, owner-confirmed

On 2026-09-03 the owner accepted the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra Wi-Fi's (`SM-X910`)
EL721 under-display fingerprint feature as functionally complete and requested
its merge into main. The hardware status is **✅ working**, replacing earlier
partial-completion estimates.

Physically confirmed on the tablet:

- Encrypted enrollment, deletion and re-enrollment through Ubuntu Settings and
  Tab Companion, using the same fprintd store throughout.
- Repeated acceptance of enrolled fingers and rejection of other fingers;
  Companion's single held-touch test identifies and highlights the matched
  saved finger.
- GDM login before a session starts and GNOME screen unlock, with password
  fallback, automatic password keyboard and portrait keyboard-overlap handling.
- Waiting fingerprint icon and illumination on contact, correctly aligned to
  the physical sensor across display rotations.
- Automatic secure startup after a full Ubuntu reboot, and successful use of
  both saved fingerprints after reboot and suspend/resume.

Tab Companion 1.2.2 includes the [fingerprint settings page](tab-companion.md#fingerprint-settings-121).
The matched [fprintd/PAM package pair](../packaging/fprintd/README.md) also passes
APT dependency checks; future image builds include and validate both packages.
This status describes the current implementation, not a newly published
installation ZIP or a security certification. Only two physical fingers have
been validated as a multi-print gallery; the ten-name capacity is software-tested.

Maintenance constraints remain: the SPU listener/DMA owner is a persistent
boot-only service and must not be stopped or restarted in place while secure
world can retain its DMA buffer. Recovery of that owner requires an Ubuntu
reboot. The [multiple-fingerprint latency report](fingerprint-gallery-performance.md)
documents the current independent-gallery cost and optional future optimization;
it is not a remaining functional blocker.

The detailed checkpoints below preserve the investigation history. This status
supersedes their earlier encryption failures, pending tests and percentage
estimates; see also the [automatic-startup checkpoint](#automatic-secure-startup-first-ubuntu-boot-2026-09-03).

### Original desktop follow-up checklist (completed)

The following records the original desktop requirements, now covered by the
owner-confirmed integration above; it is not a list of remaining work.

GNOME Settings 46.7 already handles `EnrollStatus`: progress, accepted-stage
animation, retry instructions and errors. The current console-driven probes
do not open that dialog, and the target overlay is not an enrolment wizard.
The native dialog remains supported alongside Companion's settings. GNOME Shell's
authentication prompt also supports feedback from GDM; placement near this
physical under-display sensor still requires device-specific integration.

The requested integration was:

1. Show a dim fingerprint icon while waiting; illuminate the optical target
   only during actual contact/capture, then restore brightness on release,
   completion, cancellation or failure.
2. Anchor the target to the physical sensor using the monitor's **applied
   transform**, not raw accelerometer orientation. Turning a rotation-locked
   tablet must not move the target away from the sensor.
3. Validate both screen unlock and GDM login. Keep the physical target fixed
   but orient any nearby failure text with the displayed UI.
4. Avoid overlap with the on-screen password keyboard, especially in portrait.
   If the keyboard covers the sensor, suppress the target rather than move it
   to a non-sensing location or consume password keystrokes. Password entry
   must remain usable throughout.

## Confirmed identification

- Sensor: EgisTec EL721, identified by the R03 overlay and Samsung's official
  GPL driver for the `el7xx` family.
- Type: optical reader under the AMOLED panel.
- 3.3 V supply: PMIC-B LDO2 (`VDD_BTP_3P3` / `vreg_l2b_3p3`). The stock
  X910 node has no `etspi-ldoPin`; GPIO91 is a legacy port assumption, not the
  reader's supply.
- Enable/reset: TLMM GPIO155 (`etspi-sleepPin`).
- Model reported by Samsung: `X916`.
- Stock position:
  `16.70,0.00,9.10,9.10,14.80,14.80,12.00,12.00,5.00`.

The sensor works in secure mode. Samsung's Linux driver contains neither the
recognition algorithm nor a normal path to obtain images: enrolment, matching
and templates are delegated to signed applications inside TrustZone.

The official firmware's chain is precisely identified:

```text
fingerprint-service
  → libsfp_sensor
  → libsfp_teegw
  → libQSEEComAPI (objects)
  → compatible AppLoader, UID 122
  → lookupTA("dualfp") → 23 (not loaded)
  → signed dualfp TA from /vendor/firmware_mnt/image
  → QSEEComCompat controller → BAUTH
```

No `securefp.mbn` file exists in `system`, `vendor`, `odm` or the biometric
APEX. Static analysis had shown that Samsung's gateway can use either
`securefp` or `dualfp`, but a traced One UI 8 service restart settled the live
path: it asks for `dualfp`, receives AppLoader result `23`, and loads the split
image explicitly. Both the mounted fingerprint APEX and its active update
directory are empty of TAs. A full analysis of `NON-HLOS.bin` resolved the
remaining ambiguity: `fingerpr.b00`–`b08` holds the generic QFP engine, while
`dualfp.b00`–`b08` holds the Samsung/Egis implementation of the EL721, BAUTH,
matching and templates. Preloading `authnr.mbn`, another authenticator that
references both names, did not alter Ubuntu's result.

The assembled `dualfp` image is 19,927,128 bytes. The compatible AppLoader UID
122 accepts it with `loadFromRegion` and returns a valid QSEEComCompat handle;
the subsequent unload also completes correctly. That proves the required secure
TA is present and executable from Ubuntu. A root client registered by the
upstream `quic-teec` helper does not find a preloaded object and therefore
loads the signed image explicitly, just as the measured One UI path does.

### One UI 8 as the live reference

The rooted Android 16 / One UI 8 build `X910XXS5DZA1` was measured without
reading or copying any enrolled template. Its public kernel interfaces report
`EGISTEC`, `EL721`, type `8`, a 20 MHz secure SPI clock and product ID
`EL721-B`. The fingerprint service is the AIDL v2
`vendor.samsung.hardware.biometrics.fingerprint-service`, runs as Android's
`system` UID 1000, opens `/dev/esfp0` and talks through `/dev/smcinvoke`.

A system-wide `smcinvoke` trace of a clean service start and a real fingerprint
unlock settles the important transport details:

- the service calls `lookupTA("dualfp")`, gets result `23`, allocates the TA
  image from `qcom,qseecom-ta` and opens a session successfully;
- its two persistent BAUTH buffers are `0x2a4000` bytes each and come from the
  CMA-backed `qcom,qseecom` dma-heap;
- the SHM bridges expose the rounded TA at physical `0xf5400000` with size
  `0x1302000`, and the BAUTH buffers at `0xfc300000` and `0xfc600000`; all
  three use HLOS VMID 3 and read/write permission 6;
- BAUTH requests use controller operation 0 with counts `0x0424` — four input
  buffers, two output buffers and four input objects — exactly the layout
  emitted by the Ubuntu probe;
- the real unlock trace recorded 3,839 samples with none lost; every one of the
  fingerprint service's observed controller calls completed with result zero.

A later service restart exposed an important distinction. Samsung's
`fingerprint.ko` initialises its cached sensor type to `-1` at a cold probe, but
the running One UI instance had already cached `8` in the driver. The service
therefore logged `already sensor_type checked`, skipped command `16`
(`TypeCheck`) and made command `1` (`Prepare`) its first real TA operation.
`libsfp_sensor` maps the EL721 name enum `21` to type `8`; this mapping is fixed
for the soldered X910 hardware and is not a user-selected value.

The current `dualfp` image is still 19,927,128 bytes and its code still opens
QUP1_SE2 at 20 MHz, maps input sensor-name enum `21` (`EL721`) to output type
`8`, and uses the same TypeCheck command and shared-buffer sizes. There is no
protocol drift caused by One UI 8 or by the dual-boot changes.

One UI reports its active FOD rectangle as `854,2689,993,2829`. Ubuntu's
slightly different `[854,2732]–[994,2872]` rectangle remains the one physically
validated against the Goodix raw coordinate stream; the stock value is a
reference to reconcile when rotation and the final GNOME overlay are wired up,
not a reason to change the working touch exclusion blindly.

The official image also contains Samsung's biometric service and the Egis
libraries, but they depend on Bionic, Binder, Android's biometric AIDL and
Gatekeeper tokens. That is why they are not a directly interchangeable backend
for `fprintd`.

## The prepared architecture

The infrastructure is deliberately **opt-in**. A normal build uses exactly the
DT and panel driver of the last validated commit, does not apply the Goodix FOD
extension and does not compile the EL721. QCOMTEE keeps the base's modular
configuration but stays blacklisted. For a controlled test, the combined
selector `ENABLE_FINGERPRINT_EXPERIMENTAL=1` can be used, or
`FINGERPRINT_PANEL_FOD`, `FINGERPRINT_TOUCH_FOD` and `FINGERPRINT_EL721`
enabled separately. The signed QCOMTEE module only loads with `modprobe
qcomtee`, after booting and enabling logging. This separation was introduced
after observing a reboot before the root filesystem was mounted, and it stops
another failure from becoming a bootloop.

The implementation separates four responsibilities:

1. `egis_el721.c` controls only the 3.3 V rail and the enable/reset line. It
   publishes `/dev/esfp0` for the non-sensitive part of the Egis ABI; it does
   not register the sensor as an SPI peripheral reachable from Linux.
2. `CONFIG_TEE=y` keeps the common infrastructure. In experimental builds,
   `CONFIG_QCOMTEE=m` packages Qualcomm's QTEE object transport; loading it
   manually publishes `/dev/tee0`. The Qualcomm Diagnostics transport and the
   UID 122 AppLoader are physically validated. Messages keep the upstream 4 MiB
   limit; larger TAs are delivered with a TEE memory object through
   `loadFromRegion`, without inflating the message or duplicating 20 MiB in
   CMA.
3. `panel-samsung-ana38407.c` offers the high-brightness mode an optical reader
   requires. It preserves the brightness GNOME asked for, restores it at the
   end, and forces cleanup after 15 seconds. A GNOME extension draws the target
   and compensates the global HBM outside that region.
4. The Goodix driver suppresses fingers only inside the sensor's rectangle and
   only during a biometric operation. The firmware already delivers real FOD
   `press/release` events and does not forward that contact as a normal touch.
   The rest of the screen stays usable, and disabling the session releases any
   held contacts. The session is also cancelled, rather than restored, when the
   system suspends.

GNOME 46 and `fprintd` do not themselves know a UDFPS's geometry and do not
control the panel's HBM. The `gts9u-fingerprint-overlay@agcarbajo` system
extension covers that gap in the session and at unlock; it still has to be
wired to the backend and loaded in GDM too.

## Security boundaries

These boundaries are part of the design, not optional tasks:

- Linux must not expose the EL721's frames, registers or raw SPI transactions.
  Unknown `/dev/esfp0` operations fail with `EOPNOTSUPP`.
- `/dev/esfp0` is created mode `0600`; its `ioctl`s require `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`.
  The sensor starts powered off and is powered off on suspend, on driver removal
  and at shutdown.
- Templates and matching must stay in QTEE. The port neither imports, exports
  nor reuses the fingerprints enrolled under Android.
- The legacy QSEECOM machine list is not modified. The chosen route is the
  modern QTEE transport that already exists in the pinned kernel.
- Touch exclusion must be limited to the sensor's rectangle and only during an
  active operation. Grabbing the whole device with `EVIOCGRAB` would block the
  lock screen and is not acceptable.
- Every exit, cancellation, error, suspend or client shutdown must run the
  reverse sequence: remove the circle, leave HBM, power the sensor down and
  re-enable touches. The panel's watchdog is a second line of defence, not the
  normal way to close.

## Kernel interfaces

The paths contain dynamically assigned names; the device has to be discovered
rather than its index hardcoded.

### The EL721 sensor

The character node is fixed:

```text
/dev/esfp0
```

The platform device exposes these attributes:

| Attribute | Access | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor` | read | `EGISTEC` |
| `name` | read | `EL721` |
| `model` | read | `X916` |
| `position` | read | geometric metadata from the stock overlay |
| `type_check` | read | fixed/cached Samsung sensor type (`8` for EL721) |
| `sensor_power` | read/write | state and control of GPIO91/GPIO155 |
| `reset` | write | controlled reset; accepts only `1` |
| `reset_count` | read | resets performed since boot |

They can be located without assuming the device's name:

```sh
find /sys/bus/platform/devices -type f -name vendor -exec grep -l EGISTEC {} +
```

### The ANA38407 panel

The attributes appear next to the ANA38407 backlight:

| Attribute | Access | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `fod_ready` | read | `1` when the panel is ready and on |
| `fod_mode` | read/write | optical HBM and the FlatZ sequence |
| `fod_brightness` | read | raw optical WRDISBV setting, 1623; not measured luminance |
| `fod_circle` | read/write | a diagnostic DDIC command; requires `fod_mode=1`, but draws nothing without Self Display |
| `cell_id` | read | the panel's 22-character module identifier, or `ENODATA` |

`cell_id` exists because Samsung's fingerprint TA binds the optical
calibration to the panel it was measured on. The driver reads `RX_MODULE_INFO`
(DCS `0xa1`, eleven bytes under the level-0 key) while the panel is coming up
and publishes it in Android's byte order: bytes 4..10 followed by 0..3, as
lowercase hexadecimal. It is read once per power-on, never written, and the
attribute fails with `ENODATA` rather than inventing a value if the DDIC does
not answer.

The panel keeps the desktop's requested brightness in parallel. Writing
`fod_mode=0` restores that value, and also switches the circle off if it was
active. The watchdog returns both controls to zero after 15 seconds.

This layer has already run in isolation on hardware. HBM, the watchdog and the
exact brightness restoration were validated. `fod_circle=1` reaches the DDIC
without error but produces no visible image: the Samsung kernel first loads a
Self Display image and checks its checksum. Porting that subsystem just for the
indicator gains no capture; GNOME's target is used instead. The panel on its
own is ruled out as the cause of the initial bootloop.

The ANA38407 offers no local HBM. Reading a fingerprint puts it into global
FlatZ/HBM and GNOME darkens the pixels outside the target. Being OLED, those
pixels physically emit less light even though the region is selected in the
compositor. The opacity is computed from the current brightness with the
official table: normal mode reaches 420 cd/m² at `WRDISBV=2047`, and
fingerprint HBM uses level 385 / WRDISBV 1623, approximately 634 cd/m². The
previous driver erroneously used 2047, which maps to 900 cd/m² in HBM. The
target is left out of the compensation; the rest keeps roughly its previous
luminance. These are Samsung table values, not photometer measurements.
The extension recalculates every 100 ms in case a key changes the brightness
during the read.

### Goodix touch

The UDFPS block is configured on the Goodix I²C device through four sysfs
attributes:

| Attribute | Access | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `fod_rect` | root read/write | `left top right bottom` in raw Goodix coordinates |
| `fod_enable` | root read/write | enables the FOD sponge and the regional suppression |
| `fod_property` | root read/write | Samsung's `fast/strict` policy, values `0`–`3`; default `3` |
| `fod_state` | read, pollable | `idle|pressed|released|out|vi x y sequence` |

The driver obtains the sponge's address from the SEC extension the GT6936
firmware publishes; it hardcodes no controller registers. On the physical unit
it announces `0x29800`, length 1024. The SEC structure starts after
`IC_INFO`'s ten trailing reserved bytes; skipping them yields a false address.
Like Samsung's driver, every access first wakes the firmware into normal mode
with command `0x9f` and then confirms the sponge with `0xf2`.

The raw rectangle `[854,2732]–[994,2872]` was physically validated: a finger at
the visual centre produced `released 911 2808` and `released 945 2809`. During
that same test no `BTN_TOUCH`, tracking ID or normal coordinate appeared. Each
slot is classified when it starts: a finger begun inside is consumed until
`UP`, while one begun outside keeps working even as it crosses the rectangle.

## The intended sequence for a read

The future `fprintd` backend must treat every read as a transaction:

1. check the panel, QTEE and the sensor;
2. transform the geometry to the current orientation and enable the Goodix
   exclusion for that area only;
3. power the EL721 up and, if needed, reset it;
4. show GNOME's mask/target and enable `fod_mode`;
5. ask `dualfp` for the capture or match through QTEE;
6. in an unconditional cleanup block, remove the circle and HBM, power the
   sensor down and re-enable touch.

The sensor, the circle and HBM must not be kept active between samples for
longer than the secure application asks.

## Layered validation

### 1. Non-destructive probing

After booting an experimental build, first confirm QTEE is still unloaded and
load it only with a recovery channel available:

```sh
test ! -e /dev/tee0
lsmod | grep -q '^qcomtee ' && exit 1
sudo modprobe qcomtee
```

Then:

```sh
test -c /dev/esfp0
test -c /dev/tee0
fp_vendor=$(grep -l '^EGISTEC$' /sys/bus/platform/devices/*/vendor | head -n1)
test -n "$fp_vendor"
fp_sysfs=${fp_vendor%/vendor}
for attr in vendor name model position sensor_power; do
	printf '%s: ' "$attr"
	cat "$fp_sysfs/$attr"
done
dmesg | grep -Ei 'egis|el721|qcomtee|fingerprint'
```

The expected result before starting an operation is `sensor_power=0`. The mere
existence of these nodes validates infrastructure only; it does not prove a
fingerprint can be enrolled or recognised.

### 2. Power and reset

The test runs as `root`, must be brief, and ends by powering the sensor down
even if a command fails:

```sh
fp_vendor=$(grep -l '^EGISTEC$' /sys/bus/platform/devices/*/vendor | head -n1)
test -n "$fp_vendor"
fp_sysfs=${fp_vendor%/vendor}
trap 'printf 0 > "$fp_sysfs/sensor_power"' EXIT
printf 1 > "$fp_sysfs/sensor_power"
cat "$fp_sysfs/sensor_power"
printf 1 > "$fp_sysfs/reset"
cat "$fp_sysfs/reset_count"
```

It must also be verified that the rail returns to zero after a reboot, a
shutdown, or forcing the driver's removal.

### 3. The optical panel

Tested only as `root` and with the screen on. The change must be observed for a
few seconds, never leaving HBM latched:

```sh
bl=$(for d in /sys/class/backlight/*; do
	test -e "$d/fod_ready" && { printf '%s\n' "$d"; break; }
done)
test -n "$bl"
test "$(cat "$bl/fod_ready")" = 1
trap 'printf 0 > "$bl/fod_mode"' EXIT
printf 1 > "$bl/fod_mode"
sleep 2
printf 0 > "$bl/fod_mode"
```

The validation must confirm that the previous brightness returns, that
suspending or powering off cleans the state, and that the watchdog acts if the
client dies.

### 4. Touch exclusion

Validated on 14 August 2026 on the physical tablet. With `fod_property=3`, the
GT6936 delivered `released` inside the rectangle and a simultaneous listen on
`/dev/input/event5` received no normal contact. Disabling the session made the
screen respond immediately. What remains is repeating the full authentication
experience in GDM and in all four orientations, once the backend exists.

### 5. QTEE and full authentication

The read-only query with the official `quic-teec` tools already confirms QTEE
5.2.0, Qualcomm Diagnostics and the compatible UID 122 AppLoader. Ubuntu gets
result `2` from `lookupTA("securefp")` as root and after reproducing Android's
numeric UID 1000. The live One UI 8 service does not use that alias either: it
gets `23` from `lookupTA("dualfp")` and loads the signed image. Client identity
and a supposedly hidden preloaded controller are therefore ruled out.

`scripts/probe-qtee-securefp.c` implements exactly that query. It is built
against `quic-teec` `736419e25a2036aac3292a10a93e394a90750ca3` and QCBOR
`4ace4620d549f22c1163c5b00d3ae0c0dae1d207`: it opens UID 122, runs only
`lookupTA("securefp")` and releases the returned handle without obtaining the
application object or sending it an operation. Its optional
`--client-uid=UID` opens `/dev/tee0` first and then irreversibly removes the
process's groups, UID and GID before `registerAsClient`; it cannot regain root.
This reproduced Samsung's numeric UID 1000 credential without loosening
`/dev/tee0` permissions and gave the same negative result as UID 0.

`scripts/probe-qtee-load-securefp.c` reassembles a stock split image with the
ELF offsets Qualcomm uses. It takes the segments' base name and the load name
separately. For `dualfp` it reserves a TEE memory object and uses
`loadFromRegion`; QTEE accepted the 19,927,128 bytes as `dualfp` and unloaded
them cleanly. The probe also offers `--type-check[=FIRST[-LAST]]`: the request
reaches the TA (`invoke result 0`). The stock HAL identifies `EL721` with name
enum `21` and translates it to sensor type `8`; the probe reproduces that exact
mapping. Its mutually exclusive `--prepare` selector sends the stock command
`1` in no-calibration mode and reports only result fields and returned byte
counts. Neither selector starts capture, enrolment or matching.

Qualcomm's pinned credential callback serialises `getuid()` and the current
time into the CBOR object passed to `IClientEnv.registerAsClient`. The probes
also expose a diagnostic `--kernel-client-env` path: with a narrowly gated
kernel patch it reproduces downstream smcinvoke's root operation 5 with a NULL
credentials object. That exact path also loads `dualfp` but TypeCheck remains
at type zero. The patch is disabled in normal and release builds. These are
controlled hypothesis tests, not a service design: a production backend will
run under a dedicated unprivileged identity with narrowly granted device
access.

For three sessions the TA answered `29` to everything. The cause was resolved
on 14 August 2026 by disassembling the TA itself, which is not encrypted. Its
dispatcher rejects the request and writes `29` into `rsp[4]` when the prior
validation of the embedded pointers fails, and that validation consists of
**registering each of them again as a shared buffer of `0x2a4000` bytes**:

```text
4280:  bl   0x1b0                 ; qsee_register_shared_buffer(ptr, 0x2a4000)
42b4:  cbz  w0, ok
42b8:  log  "FAIL_REGISTER_SB(%d)"
42dc:  mov  w0, #0x1d             ; 29
```

The stock gateway declares 8 bytes of payload, but its `dmabuf` allocations are
much larger, so the registration works for it. Reserving both TEE memory
objects at that exact size makes the TA accept the request and run the command:
`invoke result 0`, `trustlet=0`, response envelope zeroed. `29` simply meant
the buffers were too small.

With the transport correct, the standalone `TypeCheck` diagnostic still
returns type `0`. That command performs up to three SPI transfers and requires
reading `rx[42]==0x07` and `rx[46]==21` to declare `ET721`. It was initially
treated as the blocking result. The live service restart showed that it is not
part of the steady-state path once the platform driver already knows its one
soldered sensor, so Ubuntu now also publishes the fixed type `8` instead of
making normal operation depend on this cold-discovery helper.

The decisive follow-up reproduces `BAuth_Prepare` instead. Samsung uses a
`0x80010`-byte wire view over each persistent `0x2a4000` shared buffer. With no
Ubuntu calibration file, the input is command `1`, mode `2`, zero calibration
bytes. On the physical tablet on 22 August 2026, the signed TA answered:

```text
Prepare: invoke result 0; trustlet=0, payload=0,
         sensor_type=8, function_status=0, calibration_bytes=0
```

This is the first successful secure EL721 initialisation from Ubuntu. It also
proves that QUP1_SE2 ownership and the trusted sensor path work; the earlier
`TypeCheck=0` result is a limitation of that discovery command in this boot
context, not evidence that the TA cannot communicate with the sensor. The
one-shot cleanup then measured `sensor_power=0`, removed `/dev/tee0` and
unloaded QCOMTEE.

The bus is **QUP1_SE2**, and its pins are worth pinning down properly because
an earlier measurement was made on the wrong ones. The TA names its pads
`qup1_se2_l0..l3`, and `qup1_se2` is **gpio36–gpio39**, not gpio64–67 — those
are `qup2_se2`. The numbering agrees between the stock tree and mainline:
gpio26 is `qup1_se7` in both.

Those pins are **out of Linux's reach by design**, here and in stock: this port
declares `gpio-reserved-ranges = <36 4>` and the stock tree
`qcom,gpios-reserved = <0x20 … 0x27>`, precisely because TrustZone governs
them. The kernel does not expose them, so no sampling from user space can
observe them, and **there is no valid measurement of whether TrustZone drives
that bus or not**. The one published earlier looked at gpio64–67 and proves
nothing.

The rest of the Linux layer already mirrors stock exactly, which was checked
one item at a time: the `spi@a88000` node (`qupv3_se2_spi`) is disabled in the
stock tree too and the X910's overlay never references it; Samsung's driver in
a secure build is a `platform_driver` hanging off `soc`; and the SE's clocks
come up disabled from the bootloader, Linux does not disable them — the command
line already carries `clk_ignore_unused`, `pd_ignore_unused` and
`regulator_ignore_unused`. Holding `gcc_qupv3_wrap1_s2_clk` on from a module
does not change the result.

TrustZone's generic log is not a usable diagnostic path on this firmware. The
stock tree describes `tz-log@146AA720`, but that window contains pointers into
secure memory; reading Android's generic `/proc/tzdbg/log` rebooted the tablet.
It must not be probed again. The classic SIP call (service 6, command 2)
answers "not supported", and QTEE's Diagnostics service (UID 143) only returns
the list of loaded TAs. This no longer blocks the port because `Prepare`
provides a successful end-to-end sensor result.

It was verified that the tablet's active partitions match the analysed firmware
byte for byte: `apnhlos` matches `NON-HLOS.bin` (SHA-256 `1aa9de73…`) and `tz`
matches `tz.mbn` (`865b32e1…`). The result is not down to mixed versions or to
anti-rollback.

The helper tools live in `scripts/` and are not installed in the final image:
`probe-el721-abi.c` checks that the restricted ABI exposes only the model,
`probe-qtee-securefp.c` queries a logical name, and `probe-qtee-load-ta.c`
allows loading and unloading a small, already-assembled TA.
`probe-qtee-load-securefp.c` contains the bounded EL721 `TypeCheck` and
`Prepare` calls, while `probe-stock-qseecom.c` keeps the equivalent experiment
for linking against the stock Bionic library. None of them enrols templates or
is used as an authentication backend.

`fprintd` is now present in the image, but nothing can be enrolled through it
yet and the reader is not advertised as working. These have to be validated, in
this order, before that changes:

- enrolment and cancellation without leaving HBM, the sensor or the touch block
  active;
- several correct verifications and wrong fingers;
- unlocking GNOME and authenticating in GDM;
- suspend/resume, rotation and brightness changes during a read;
- a reboot with no loss and no exposure of templates;
- recovery after the backend crashes and after the watchdog expires.

Until that whole matrix passes, the public status stays experimental and
fingerprint authentication is considered unavailable.

## The userspace backend

With `Prepare` working, the probes stopped being the right shape for the job
and the backend was written properly. It lives in `packaging/libfprint/` and is
built into a replacement `libfprint-2-2` package by
`scripts/build-libfprint-el721.sh`; the Noble package it replaces keeps its ABI
version, so the device package pins the local build explicitly.

`el721-qtee.c` is the QTEE side. It owns the whole secure transaction: it opens
`/dev/tee0`, registers as a client, assembles and loads the signed `dualfp`
image, keeps the two `0x2a4000` shared buffers alive for the session, serves
the QIS callback listener the TA registers, and exposes Samsung's BAUTH command
set as ordinary C functions — `Prepare`, the generic control command `12`, the
active-group key, and the `EnrollInit`/`Do`/`Final`,
`IdentifyInit`/`Do`/`Final` and `Cancel` pairs. Three details were measured on
the tablet rather than guessed: the calibrated `Prepare` is retried through the
same opcode transitions One UI uses, where opcode `8` means reset the sensor
and opcode `9` is acknowledged with control opcode `83` instead of a power
cycle; the two bootstrap controls are advisory, and operation `76` answers
status `51` on this tablet while startup continues; and the optical
`egoptbds.dat` blob is uploaded in chunks through the control command rather
than in one message.

The calibration inputs are proprietary and stay out of the repository.
`scripts/import-fingerprint-firmware.sh` packages them from a directory the
tablet's owner extracts from their own matching firmware, checking each file
against a pinned hash: the nine `dualfp` segments, `calib.dat` and
`egoptbds.dat`. The panel's `cell_id` completes that set from the running
hardware.

`el721.c` is the `libfprint` driver on top. `libfprint` has no bus that can see
a platform device, so `patches/0001-el721-platform-driver.patch` adds the
enumeration path; the driver itself powers the rail, runs `Prepare`, raises the
panel's HBM for the duration of the operation, follows the finger through the
Goodix FOD state, drives the enrol and identify loops, converts the TA's opaque
template blob into an `FpPrint`, and unwinds power, HBM and touch suppression
on every exit — including cancellation and timeout. Templates are stored by
`fprintd` as the TA emitted them; Linux never parses them and never touches
Android's enrolled data.

The lifecycle around it is packaged too. `ubuntu-gts9u-qcomtee.service` loads
the QCOMTEE module before `fprintd`, a drop-in grants `fprintd` the single
extra device it needs (`/dev/tee0` read/write, leaving the rest of the stock
sandbox intact), and `ubuntu-gts9u-fingerprint-cleanup` returns HBM, the touch
block and the sensor rail to zero if `fprintd` dies or is upgraded mid-read.

## What 29 and 51 actually mean

Two status codes drove most of the guesswork, and disassembling the TA's own
dispatcher settled both. The command table is a jump table of nineteen
entries, and every handler starts by checking the exact wire sizes of the
request and the response:

| Command | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 `Prepare` | `0x80010` | `0x80010` |
| 2 `EnrollInit` | `0x178` | `0xc` |
| 8 | `0x510` | `0x40c` |
| 9 | `0x914` | `8` |
| 10 `Cancel` | `8` | `8` |
| 12 `Control` | `0x2a3110` | `0x2a3010` |
| 13 `HatOp` | `0x48d` | `0x40c` |

**51 is a size mismatch.** A handler that does not recognise the declared
lengths logs `invalid length` and answers 51; every control operation that
answered 51 was answering that, not refusing the operation.

**29 has two different sources.** The dispatcher registers both non-secure
pointers with `qsee_register_shared_buffer` before it dispatches, and writes
29 if that fails — this is the historical meaning, and it is satisfied. The
enrolment path returns the same number for an unrelated reason:
`init_enroll_stub` calls into Samsung's `tz_vigis_api.c`, which returns `0x1d`
when the optical engine's global context is still NULL. The context is created
by `prepare_stub`, and Ubuntu's `Prepare` returns all zeros without creating
it, because it is missing the optical data One UI loads first.

The kernel side of the old theory was still worth fixing and is in tree.
`qcomtee-bridge-large-objects.patch` gives every memory object in the BAUTH
size range its own contiguous DMA32 allocation and its own SHM bridge, instead
of a suballocation inside a larger bridged TZMEM area; the threshold matters,
because 2.76 MB fell under `SZ_4M` and silently took the page-backed path.

## The current state and the next step

Everything above the secure boundary is written; nothing above it is proven.
The last measured milestone is still the calibrated `Prepare`. The enrol chain
— generating the active-group key, `EnrollInit`, the `EnrollDo` loop with a
real finger under HBM, and an `EnrollFinal` that returns a template — has been
exercised repeatedly against the TA but has never been carried through to a
stored template, and identification has not been attempted at all.

`el721-qtee-selftest.c` is the harness for exactly that step. It powers the
sensor, opens the session, runs the calibrated `Prepare`, optionally sets the
active group and issues a single `EnrollInit` followed by `Cancel`, and powers
the sensor back down whether or not the call succeeded. It records no biometric
data.

The next milestone is therefore a single successful enrolment, and it is also
the port's go/no-go point. Booting One UI settled what of the optical bring-up
is actually missing, and it is less than it looked. `gdxrtcalib.dat` and
`cbge_*.dat` do not exist anywhere on this tablet: those are Goodix paths that
the gateway carries for other models, and the Egis EL721 never uses them.
`/data/vendor/biometrics/meta` holds exactly the two files already imported.
The panel's `window_type` reads `80 00 04` under One UI, and its `cell_id`
matches the value the ported ANA38407 driver publishes byte for byte. With
those bytes supplied, controls 401 and 402 are both accepted.

A traced One UI enrolment then gave the exact sequence the service performs,
which is worth writing down because it is the specification the Ubuntu backend
has to meet:

```text
pre_enroll : control 22 (set_enroll_session, gSession_Flag = 1)
             command 19 (generate challenge)
enroll     : control 84 (the gateway logs "skip")
             register the QIS callback
             skeymast command 0x203, dualfp command 15, then control 49
             to install dualfp's HAT HMAC key without exposing it to Linux
             command 13, the authentication token, right before enrolling
             command 2  EnrollInit  -> CAPTURE_READY
             command 3  EnrollDo, repeatedly; opcode 4 is
                        BAUTH_OP_CODE_WAIT_INTERRUPT with timeout -1, and the
                        host enables the sensor interrupt and waits
             on opcode 5: control 87 with one response byte, then control 80
                          with four response bytes
             on opcode 87: control 87 with one response byte
             command 4  EnrollFinal after every capture, then repeat Init
```

Reproducing that sequence corrected several things in the bridge, all of them
read out of the TA rather than guessed. Its control command validates a
response-capacity field the caller writes into the output buffer at
`0x2a300c`; operation 12 refuses to run with anything under `0x226000` and
answers 51, which is what that number always means — the declared wire sizes
are not the ones the handler expects. Operation 48 is
`BAUTH_OP_CODE_SEND_STOREPATH` and answers 29 until it is given a path.
Operation 49 is `SEND_KEY`: it consumes the metadata returned by dualfp's
command 15 after skeymast encapsulates the current HAT key for target
`"dualfp"` with command `0x203`. Linux relays only the secure-world envelope
and decoded metadata; the raw HMAC key never enters normal-world memory. The
optical `egoptbds.dat` goes up in
`0x3000`-byte pieces with nothing in the scalar field, exactly as One UI's
`load_bds()` walks it. Operations 401, 402, 84 and 108 land in the TA's
default case, so 21 simply means this build does not implement them.

The command table itself is now mapped, so no size has to be guessed again:

| Command | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Prepare | `0x80010` | `0x80010` |
| 2 EnrollInit | `0x178` | `0xc` |
| 3 EnrollDo | `0xc` | `0x230024` |
| 4 EnrollFinal | `0xc` | `0xa018` |
| 6 IdentifyDo | `0xc` | `0x230089` |
| 10 Cancel | `8` | `8` |
| 13 Hat_OP | `0x48d` | `0x40c` |
| 19 Challenge | `0xc` | `0x44` |

With every one of those corrections in place, `EnrollInit` still answers 29,
and so do `EnrollDo` and `IdentifyDo` — with or without a preceding `Prepare`,
and against a freshly loaded TA. Disassembling that number to its source
settles what is really wrong, and it is not the transport.

`tz_vigis_api.c` answers 29 when the optical engine's global context is
missing. That context is created in `fp_prepare_state_handler`, and only after
`fpsec_open_sensor` succeeds — which first calls `fpsec_spi_open`, which opens
the secure SPI instance and sets its clock to 20 MHz. When that fails the
handler logs, skips the allocation and still lets `Prepare` return zero in
every field the caller can see. So the successful `Prepare` never meant the
sensor had been opened: it means the command ran, and the sensor type is a
constant the TA already knows.

That reading was wrong, and the correction matters. `prepare_stub` calls
`fp_sdk_uninit` first, which is what puts the state global at zero, and
`fp_prepare_state_handler` propagates any failure back through `Prepare`'s
result word. Since that word is zero, the sensor does open and the engine
context is created. The enrolment path returns 29 from the other branch that
yields the same number: `fp_enroll_init` calls `enroll_init_v2`, the Egis
matcher's own entry point, and that is what fails.

Two further things were settled by measurement. Holding
`gcc_qupv3_wrap1_s2_clk` on with its source at 80 MHz changes nothing, so the
serial engine's clock is not the obstacle. The earlier conclusion that control
49 decoded a template was wrong: its internal `decode_metadata` call decodes
the key metadata produced by command 15, then copies the resulting 32-byte key
into dualfp's HAT verifier. It is a prerequisite for authenticated enrolment.

A traced One UI **cold start** — restarting the stock service with the log
running — then gave the init sequence, which had been guesswork until now:

```text
load the TA, then two shared buffers of 0x2a3110 and 0x2a3010 bytes
command 1   Prepare
control 76  with room declared for a response
control 88  (this build answers 51; the stock service skips the calibration
            update for an optical sensor anyway)
control 81  reset the optical blob
control 82  the blob itself, 1204124 bytes in one piece
control 22  set_enroll_session
```

Two of those were wrong here and are now fixed. Operation 76 answers 51 unless
the caller declares a response capacity, exactly like operation 12. And the
optical blob does not go through operation 81 at all: 81 only frees whatever
the TA holds, and 82 appends, with a chunk index of 0 to 3 in the scalar field
and up to `0x2a3000` bytes per chunk, the first chunk declaring the total. This
port was sending the bytes to 81, which threw them away.

Disassembling what the matcher's configuration is built from finally named the
missing input. The TA carries a table of twenty-nine Samsung model codes —
`A505`, `T865`, … `X916`, `S711` — and looks the running board up in it by
name, storing the index in the sensor structure the matcher configuration is
built from. Index 27 is `X916`, exactly what this tablet's kernel driver
reports and what the stock service logs as `mi X916` at start-up. Control
operation 88, the one this port had been sending empty, is that lookup.

Two operations reach that setter, 88 and 90, and the difference between them
is one log line: the 88 case also prints the name, and doing that over the
non-secure buffer takes the TA down — QTEE then answers -90 to the invocation,
and it happens for any declared payload length above zero. Operation 90 does
the same lookup without the log and is accepted, so the bridge uses 90.

With the model selected, control 76 answered, the optical blob uploaded
through 82 and the enrolment session set, the initialisation now matches the
stock trace call for call, and `EnrollInit` still answers 29.

What remains is below all of that, and two measurements say so plainly.

`Prepare` takes **1.06 seconds** here. The same command in the traced One UI
cold start takes **32 milliseconds**. And it takes the same 1.06 seconds with
the sensor's rail on as with it off — if the TA were running SPI transfers, an
unpowered sensor would not cost exactly as much as a powered one. A second
`Prepare` in the same session returns in 130 ms, which is the short path the
handler takes once the state is no longer zero.

Put together: the first `Prepare` runs the full path, spends about a second
inside `fpsec_open_sensor` getting nothing, leaves the engine context
unallocated and still reports zero in every field the caller can see. Every
later failure follows from that — `enroll_init_v2` finds no matter at field
`0x2f98` of a handle that was never built, and answers 29.

So the remaining defect is that **TrustZone gets nothing from the EL721 over
the secure SPI in this boot**, and the BAUTH command sequence above it is now
correct. Command 16 is the one-line probe for it: it answers zero whether the
sensor is powered or not, where stock reads a real type.

Chasing why led somewhere embarrassing and simple. The reader's 3.3 V does not
come from a GPIO-controlled LDO on this board: the stock node carries
`etspi-regulator = "VDD_BTP_3P3"` and no `etspi-ldoPin`, and the fixups map
that rail to the PMIC's `pm_humu_l2`. This port drives GPIO91 as if it were an
LDO enable and never claims a supply at all, so the kernel log reads

```text
egis-el721 egis-el721: supply vdd not found, using dummy regulator
```

The device the port registers for the reader is synthetic and carries no
device-tree node, so the `vdd-supply` written next to `egistec,el721` never
reaches it. Claiming the rail by name from a test module gets a consumer onto
`vreg_l2b_3p3`, but that regulator refuses both `regulator_set_voltage` and
`regulator_get_voltage` with `EINVAL` and reports 0 mV, so it is not driving
anything either.

**The EL721 had never been powered under this port.** Everything above follows
from that: no sensor answers, so TrustZone's `fpsec_open_sensor` spends a
second getting nothing, the engine context is never allocated, and every
biometric command answers 29. The driver now claims `vdd` and sequences it the
way the stock driver does.

Getting the rail itself to exist took three tries, and the reasons are worth
keeping. It cannot be described in the board file: Samsung's ABL bootloops on
any vendor_boot DTB whose structure moves, measured twice, and repacking that
image with the tree untouched reproduces the working one to the byte, so the
packing was never at fault. It cannot be added from `postcore_initcall`
either — that panics before anything can be logged. What does work is adding
it later, from a module, with `of_changeset`: a sibling `regulators-el721`
node under the same RSC, carrying `ldo2`, plus a consumer node that references
it by phandle. Giving that node its own platform device gets the RPMh driver
to register the rail without disturbing the rails already up.

The last obstacle there was arithmetic. The stock overlay asks this rail for
3.3 V exactly, but mainline's PMIC5 p-type LDO steps 8 mV from 1.504 V and
3.3 V lands half a step off the grid, so registration failed with
`ENOTRECOVERABLE` until the constraint was widened to the neighbouring points.
The rail now registers and enables at **3,296,000 µV**.

With it powered, the TA's answer changes for the first time in this whole
investigation: `Prepare` returns `sensor_type=0` where it had always returned
the constant 8. It only does so when the rail is up *and* the GPIO lines are
driven — rail alone, or lines alone, still give 8. So the reader is finally
being reached, and what the TA now reports is that it cannot identify it.

Narrowing that further ruled out the obvious suspects. GPIO91, which this port
drives as if it enabled an LDO although the stock node declares no
`etspi-ldoPin`, turns out not to matter: with the rail up and only the stock
sleep line driven, the answer is the same zero. Neither a reset pulse on that
line nor settling for 200 ms changes it, and `Prepare` still takes its full
second. The reader has power, its enable line is high and it has been reset,
and TrustZone still cannot identify it over the secure SPI.

Two facts point at where to look next. The tablet's own clock tree shows
`gcc_qupv3_wrap1_s2_clk` disabled with its source parked at 5.12 MHz, while
the TA asks for 20 MHz; and `gcc_qupv3_wrap1_s7_clk` is enabled, so the
wrapper itself is powered and its AHB clocks cannot be the whole story. The remaining gate is inside Samsung's engine
rather than in the transport: the enrolment worker in `tz_vigis_api.c` reaches
`fp_enroll_init` in `vigis_controller.c`, and that call returns failure. The
same TA also validates authentication tokens — an all-zero `BAuth_Hat_OP`
envelope (command 13, `0x48d`/`0x40c`) is rejected with 62 rather than ignored
— so the token path is live and may well be the gate.

The older risk has not gone away either: the TA also carries `BAuth_Hat_OP`,
`BAuth_GetK_From_KM` and `BAuth_Generate_Challenge`, so enrolment may still
require a Gatekeeper-signed authentication token that this platform cannot
produce. That would be a boundary rather than a defect. If a template does come
back, what remains is ordinary engineering: the identify loop and its control
sub-opcodes, replacing the 45 ms Goodix poll with the sensor's own interrupt,
template persistence across reboots, the GDM and session integration, and the
validation matrix above.

## The secure SPI pins belong to TrustZone, and must not be touched

With the rail up, the panel awake and its optical mode engaged, `Prepare` still
answers `sensor_type=0` and `EnrollInit` still answers 29, so the display state
is not the gate either.

The pin muxing looked like the next candidate, and the reasoning was sound as
far as it went. `qup1_se2` — the serial engine behind `spi@a88000`, the one the
TA's clock request names — spans `gpio36`..`gpio39` here, and pinctrl reports
all four as `UNCLAIMED`: no Linux driver owns them, because neither the stock
tree nor this port describes an SPI controller for the reader. The TA's own log
strings name a matching failure, `qsee_tlmm_get_gpio_id: BLSP_CLK Failed`,
which is what a serial-engine function lookup returns when no pin carries it.

That hypothesis is wrong, and the way it failed is the answer. debugfs is
locked down here, so `pinmux-select` returns `EPERM`; writing the four TLMM
configuration registers directly from a module instead **hard-resets the
tablet**. The kernel log of that boot simply stops — no shutdown sequence, no
panic, nothing flushed — which is the signature of an XPU violation, not of a
software fault.

So those registers are secure-owned. TrustZone holds the pins exactly as it
holds the serial engine, it muxes them itself, and a non-secure write to them
takes the SoC down. `UNCLAIMED` in pinctrl means only that Linux has not
claimed them, which is the correct and expected state on this board.

Two things follow. The mux is not the defect and cannot be made one from
Linux — that avenue is closed, and the module that tried it has been deleted so
it cannot be loaded again by accident. And the reset is itself a positive
result: it confirms that `gpio36`..`gpio39` really are the reader's secure SPI
and that TrustZone owns that path end to end.

## What 29 really was: the matcher was never built

Disassembling the number to its source, rather than reasoning about it, ended
the investigation. The chain is short and every link is checkable.

`EnrollInit` reaches `fp_enroll_init`, which calls `matcher_api_enroll_init`,
whose very first act is `enroll_init_v2`. That function asks the fingerprint
context for its matcher object — field `0x2f98` — and fails immediately when it
is null. Only one function in the whole TA ever writes that field, and it is
reached only from `matcher_api_init`.

`matcher_api_init` builds the matcher from one of two sources. If the model
index is set it reads the matcher configuration from the global the model
lookup fills. Otherwise it falls back to the sensor type and accepts only the
values 1 to 4 — and on anything else it returns without building anything,
which is exactly the silent path this port was taking. That also settles an old
red herring: the `sensor_type` this port used to report, 8, would have failed
that test just as surely as the 0 it reports now. Sensor identification was
never the route to enrolment; the model index is.

The model index is set by `fp_set_model_type`, and the dispatcher reaches it
from two control operations. Reading the jump table at `0x27a0e0` names them
exactly:

| operation | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| 88 | `fp_set_model_type`, **then builds the matcher configuration** |
| 90 | `fp_set_model_type` and nothing else |

This port had been sending 90, on the belief that 88 crashed the TA. It does
not: both operations log the model name identically, so the log was never the
difference, and 88 accepts the same five-byte `"X916"` payload without
complaint. The earlier failure belonged to how the call was framed, not to the
operation.

With the bridge switched to operation 88, `EnrollInit` answers
`result=0 status=0 opcode=0` for the first time in this port's history, and
`Cancel` — corrected to its measured 8-byte envelope — answers cleanly too.

## Where the port stands after enrolment starts

With operation 88 in place the whole enrolment chain runs, and a first live test
with a finger on the reader measured exactly where it stops.

```text
EnrollInit user=User_0: result=0 status=0 opcode=0
EnrollDo 1: result=0 status=-1 quality=0 progress=0 remaining=0
EnrollDo 2: result=0 status=0  quality=0 progress=0 remaining=0
EnrollDo 3: BAUTH command 3 failed (trustlet=39)
```

The reply is identical with a finger pressed on the reader and with the screen
untouched, and the same 39 comes back from `EnrollFinal` when nothing was
captured. So the state machine is correct and the sequence above it is correct;
what does not happen is the capture itself.

That is consistent with everything else measured. The TA's enrolment worker
waits in `[ESTATE_FINGER_DOWN]` for `fpsec_start_get_image`, and finger
presence on this reader is reported over the sensor's own link — the stock node
declares no interrupt line, only `etspi-sleepPin`. With TrustZone getting
nothing back over the secure SPI there is no finger-down to wait for, so the
worker falls through and the capture returns empty.

One open item therefore remains, and it is now stated much more narrowly than
before: **TrustZone cannot read the EL721 over the secure SPI.** Power, the
sleep line, the panel state, the pin mux and the whole BAUTH command sequence
have each been tested and are not the cause. Until that is solved a finger
cannot be enrolled, and until a finger can be enrolled the libfprint and
fprintd integration cannot be validated.

## Enrolment is an interactive protocol, and this port was not speaking it

The captured One UI enrolment trace settles how a capture actually works, and
it is not the loop this port was running. `EnrollDo` does not take an image and
return it. It returns an **opcode** telling the non-secure side what to do next,
and expects to be called again once that has been done:

```text
cmd 0x2  EnrollInit  -> opcode 0,  function_status 0   CAPTURE_READY
cmd 0x3  EnrollDo    -> opcode 4,  timeout -1          BAUTH_OP_CODE_WAIT_INTERRUPT
         (host enables the reader's interrupt, waits for it, disables it)
cmd 0x3  EnrollDo    -> opcode 5                       BAUTH_OP_CODE_NOTIFY_DOWN
         control 87, then control 80                   CAPTURE_STARTED
cmd 0x3  EnrollDo    -> opcode 87
         control 87
cmd 0x3  EnrollDo    -> opcode 6                       NOTIFY_CAPTURE_SUCCESS
cmd 0x3  EnrollDo    -> opcode 0,  function_status 1   CAPTURE_COMPLETED
cmd 0x4  EnrollFinal                                   CAPTURE_SUCCESS
         control 76, and the whole sequence repeats for the next capture
```

Two things follow that were not understood before. `EnrollFinal` runs once per
capture rather than once per enrolment, each pass starting again at
`EnrollInit`. And the earlier reading of the first live finger test — that the
reader was returning "no finger" — was wrong: the port was calling `EnrollDo`
repeatedly without honouring the opcode or issuing controls 87 and 80, which is
why the TA eventually answered 39. The harness now implements the protocol.

That correction does not make capture work, and it sharpens where it stops. The
port's first `EnrollDo` answers `opcode 0` with `function_status -1`, where
stock answers `opcode 4` at exactly the same point — so the failure is inside
the first call, before any interrupt is ever waited for.

The same trace also shows stock issuing `Challenge` (command 19) and then
`Hat_OP` (command 13) before `EnrollInit`. `Challenge` succeeds here.
`Hat_OP` does not: it needs its full 1165-byte envelope — anything else is
refused with 51 — and refuses an all-zero envelope with 62. That is a
Gatekeeper-signed authentication token, and this platform has no Gatekeeper to
produce one.

So two candidate blockers remain, and they have not yet been told apart:
TrustZone getting nothing from the sensor, and the missing authentication
token. The TA's own sensor self-test is control operation 19, and it is accepted
when no response capacity is declared, which is the thread to pull next.

## The reader answers an all-zero identity, and that is the whole defect

Following the failure inside the first `EnrollDo` reaches the sensor rather than
the token, which tells the two remaining candidates apart. `fp_enroll_state_handler`
fails in `[ESTATE_INIT]` on a virtual call into the TA's own sensor driver, so
the missing Gatekeeper token is not what stops a capture.

The identification path then explains every symptom at once.
`fpsec_open_sensor` calls `device_identify_type`, which polls
`device_et7xx_get_fp_type` — a three-byte read of the reader's identity
register — **twenty-one times**, one millisecond apart, giving up only when the
type is still zero. That is exactly the second that `Prepare` costs here, where
the traced One UI cold start costs 32 ms because it identifies on the first
attempt. With no type, the TA binds no sensor driver, and every later call into
that driver fails.

So the defect is not in the command sequence, the matcher, the model, the
protocol or the token: **the EL721 returns an all-zero identity to TrustZone.**

One real fault was found and fixed while confirming this. The rail module drove
the sleep line *before* enabling the rail, the reverse of the stock driver's
order, which leaves the part without a clean reset because a signal pin is being
driven into an unpowered chip. It now enables the rail, settles 2.3 ms, then
takes the line low and raises it with the stock's 1.1 ms and 5 ms waits. That is
correct on its own terms and should stay, but it does not change the answer: the
identity still reads zero and `Prepare` still costs its full second.

## The QUP serial engine route, tested and excluded

The identity read timing — about 60 ms per attempt, twenty-one attempts — says
the transfers are timing out rather than returning zeros quickly, which pointed
at the serial engine itself. That has now been tested from every angle Linux can
reach, and none of it is the cause.

**Clocks.** The QUP wrapper's core clocks are reachable only straight from the
GCC provider, having no consumer in the device tree, and mainline leaves them
gated. Holding `gcc_qupv3_wrap1_core_2x_clk`, `gcc_qupv3_wrap1_core_clk`, the
`m_ahb`/`s_ahb` pair and the serial engine's own branch all on at once, with the
interconnect paths voted, changes nothing: the identity still reads zero and
`Prepare` still costs its full second. The captured stock kernel trace settles
why that was never promising — Android does not touch `gcc_qupv3_wrap1_s2_clk`
during fingerprint activity either, so enabling it was never the HLOS's job.

**Callbacks.** Stock registers a "QSEE Interrupt Service Listener" at boot, which
raised the possibility that TrustZone waits on the non-secure world to forward
the serial engine's interrupt — a good fit for 60 ms timeouts. It does not
apply. This port's bridge already runs a supplicant that services secure-world
callbacks, and instrumenting it shows the TA making exactly two callbacks up
front and then none at all across the 1.2 seconds of the identification loop.
TrustZone is not waiting on us; it is driving the bus itself and getting
nothing back.

What remains unexamined is the serial engine's own state — whether it is
configured and running at all — and those registers cannot be read from Linux
without risking the same XPU fault that the pin experiment produced.

## One UI says the sensor type is 8, and that changes the diagnosis

Booting the stock firmware and asking its own driver, with the reader working,
settles what a correct reading looks like:

```text
name         EL721
vendor       EGISTEC
type_check   8
bfs_values   "FP_SPICLK":"20000000"
```

**Eight is the right answer.** It is exactly what this port reported before any
of the power work, and what was written off here as a constant the TA already
knew. The zero it reports now is the broken reading, not the honest one — this
document had it backwards, and so did every conclusion drawn from it.

The stock driver's periodic state dump says the rest:

```text
fps_el7xx_work_func_debug: ldo: 0, sleep: 0, tz: 1, spi_value: 0x0, type: EL721
```

At idle the LDO pin is low and **the sleep line is low**, where this port holds
it high continuously. So the two defects were masking each other. While the port
reported the correct 8, enrolment failed for an unrelated reason — the model was
being selected through operation 90, which never builds the matcher. By the time
operation 88 fixed that, the reader had been moved into a state that reports 0.

What this predicts is specific and cheap to test: back under Ubuntu, without the
rail module driving the sleep line, `Prepare` should report 8 again, and with
the model now selected through 88 the enrolment chain should run against a
sensor that answers.

## The earlier enrolment success was on a degenerate path

Back under Ubuntu with nothing forcing the sleep line, `Prepare` reports
`sensor_type=8` again, exactly as One UI does. That confirms the reading above
and forces a correction to the section before it.

Operation 88 was reported here as the fix that made `EnrollInit` succeed. It
does — **but only while the reader has not been identified.** With the sensor
answering 8, operation 88 takes the TA down with `-90` every time: before the
optical blob and after it, with a declared response capacity and without, sent
from the bridge's own init or from the harness. It never crashed earlier only
because the rail module had driven the reader into the state that answers 0, so
the TA had bound no sensor driver and the call stopped short of
`fp_check_white_spot_and_apply_wsc_to_wk_bk`.

So that `EnrollInit user=User_0: result=0` was a matcher built over an
unidentified sensor. It could never have enrolled a finger, and the claim that
enrolment "starts" was wrong.

With the reader answering properly the position is:

| model selection | result |
| --- | --- |
| operation 88 | the TA goes down with `-90` |
| operation 90 | `EnrollInit` answers 29, the matcher is not built |
| skipped | `EnrollInit` answers 29 |

One suspicion was checked and cleared while narrowing this. The per-device
factory calibration `fp_check_white_spot_and_apply_wsc_to_wk_bk` needs is not
missing: `sec_efs/biometrics/meta/egis_calibration_data.bin` is byte-identical
to the port's `calib.dat`, the optical blob matches the size the stock service
uploads, and the stored `cell_id` matches the panel's. The inputs are right.

The default therefore goes back to operation 90, which leaves the matcher
unbuilt but cannot crash the TA; `EL721_MODEL_OP` selects the other.

## What the reader must answer, to the byte

The identification is a three-byte read, and the TA maps it with no room for
interpretation:

| bytes 4 and 5 | sensor type |
| --- | --- |
| `07 0D` | 2 |
| `07 0F` | 3 |
| `07 15` | 4 — the ET721, this reader |
| anything else | 0 |

The driver selector then binds a sensor driver for **2, 3 and 4 only**. Every
other value, zero included, leaves `[0x4a0310 + 0x150]` null, and that null is
the crash: `fpsec_get_badpixel_map_EL721` loads its method from that pointer's
vtable, which is where operation 88 takes the TA down.

This corrects the section above it, which was too quick. One UI's `type_check`
of 8 is the **kernel driver's** own enum, not the TA's, and the two are not the
same scale — the TA has no type 8 at all. So the port reporting 8 was never
evidence that the reader had been identified, and neither 8 nor 0 binds a
driver. Both mean the same thing: the reader did not answer `07 15`.

That is the defect, stated as precisely as it can be: **the EL721 does not
return its identity bytes to TrustZone over the secure SPI.** Everything else —
the transport, the command envelopes, the model table, the matcher, the
interactive capture protocol, the calibration inputs, the rail and its
sequencing — is correct and verified. Nothing above this layer can work until
the reader answers, and the answer it must give is `07 15`.

## Cold-boot parity and the early-rail boot regression

A cold One UI trace removes the last ambiguity in the non-secure power path.
At uptime 8.707239 it enables `VDD_BTP_3P3`, at 8.719568 it raises GPIO155,
and only then enters `smcinvoke`. It neither claims nor drives GPIO91, and it
does not ask HLOS to claim or clock the secure QUP engine. This is the sequence
the port must reproduce: PMIC rail first, GPIO155 second, trusted call last.

Three Ubuntu A/B images then reset between ABL decompression and the first
persisted Linux message: an incremental build without GPIO91, a clean build
without it, and a same-tree rebuild with GPIO91 restored. All kept the known
DTB hash `613b3bb7...`; all failed before a panic or kernel log existed. The
known-good `boot.img` (`9d4ace88...`) boots with either module set and its
kernel contains no `vreg_l2b_3p3` publication code. GPIO91 is therefore not the
cause of this bootloop.

The common delta was `postcore_initcall(el721_add_rail)`, which changed the
live OF tree while core providers were still starting. That path has been
removed. The companion now probes with no supply mutation and publishes the
already-validated `regulators-el721` sibling only on the first explicit
fingerprint power request. It uses the PMIC5-valid 3,296,000–3,304,000 µV
window, attaches the synthetic consumer after the changeset is live, and
allows the RPMh regulator driver to finish binding before acquisition.

The redesigned driver and complete experimental kernel compile cleanly;
`checkpatch.pl` reports no warnings and the linked image has SHA-256
`1539dd48f6562a39edab3cad6dfe03e1b896d82102a6f1ae14e1453166c9be13`.
The same late changeset was first loaded on the stable tablet with power
disabled, registered `vreg_l2b_3p3`, and reverted cleanly without a reboot.
The reviewed image was then packed as Android v4 boot
`d315e4ffc751a6fb2e96ccb5b49fa623c0dfe760000882bcbd5e552574d7cbb4`
and booted on the first attempt. At idle `/el721-supply` was absent and the
companion reported the sensor off. Its first explicit power request created
the supply, registered the regulator at 3,296 mV and raised its consumer count
to one; powering off returned that count to zero without a reset or warning.

The current QTEE-backed self-test then loaded the signed `dualfp` application
and ran calibrated `Prepare`. Transport, invoke result, function status and
opcode were all zero. That reply was initially rejected because word zero was
still being interpreted as an internal sensor type.

## A zeroed `Prepare` is success, and `EnrollInit` now works

The stock cold-start log resolves the ambiguity in that response. Its public
type `8` comes from command 16, the separate `TypeCheck`; after command 1 it
logs a successful `check_opcode` with every status field zero. The `8` once
seen in word zero of Ubuntu's unpowered `Prepare` was a host-work/reset status,
not an EL721 identity. Treating it as the sensor type both skipped that work
and made the properly powered all-zero reply look like failure.

A signed diagnostic module then reproduced the complete stock sequence from a
cold Ubuntu boot: GPIO155 was acquired low, the regulator load was set to
100 mA, `vreg_l2b_3p3` was enabled at 3,296 mV, the stock 2.3 ms delay elapsed,
and only then was GPIO155 raised. Calibrated `Prepare` returned `0/0/0/0` and
continued successfully through control 76 and the optical blob upload. The
module always lowered GPIO155, disabled the rail, removed the temporary
regulator node and unloaded QCOMTEE on exit.

The remaining matcher failure was the model selector. Operation 90 only stores
the `X916` table index and leaves the matcher absent, so `EnrollInit` answers
29. Operation 88 performs the same lookup and constructs the matcher. With 88
as the default, the physical tablet now reports:

```text
Prepare:       status=0 result=0 function_status=0 opcode=0
EnrollInit:    result=0 status=0 opcode=0
Cancel:        result=0 status=0 opcode=0
```

This supersedes the earlier secure-SPI diagnosis and the claim that operation
88 succeeds only on a degenerate path. The sensor and trusted path initialise
well enough to create the real matcher and enter enrolment. A single
non-interactive `EnrollDo` without HBM, a finger or the Android pre-enrol token
sequence returns status `-1` and no template, as expected; physical capture is
the next unproven boundary.

Controls 45 and 46 were also mislabelled in the early bridge as a wrapped
active-group-key pair. Static names and the stock trace identify them as secure
authenticator-ID operations, while Android's active-user path uses storage
operation 48. The self-test no longer sends 45/46 by default.

The corrected complete libfprint driver builds in the pinned ARM64 environment
without an EL721 warning. Package `gts9u4` was installed over `gts9u3` after
backing up the previous library. Through the system library — not an injected
test copy — the tablet enumerated the EL721, loaded `dualfp`, completed the
all-zero `Prepare`, selected `X916`, uploaded the optical blob, opened the
device and closed it with the rail off. The two owner-derived calibration files
were also installed in the firmware directory the production driver uses; no
template or fingerprint image was read or written.

## The production enrol path now consumes physical FOD events

Running the driver through `fprintd-enroll` exposed integration faults which
the standalone harness could not show. A second `Prepare` in the already-open
QTEE session was rejected with BAUTH status 29, so operation setup now only
restores sensor power. The ten libfprint finger identifiers are mapped
deterministically onto BAUTH's four secure template slots; the four-print limit
and collision policy still need a user-facing decision.

Optical mode has also been made suitable for a real enrol operation. Libfprint
refreshes `fod_mode` every five seconds so the panel's 15-second safety
watchdog cannot terminate HBM in the middle of enrolment. It no longer tries
to call a user's D-Bus session from root. Overlay version 7 instead polls the
panel's `fod_mode` and follows that kernel state. This ordering is important:
the temporary test watcher could show its compensating black shade before HBM
was active, briefly making the entire desktop and target darker before the
panel brightened. Version 7 should remove that race, but it remains a visual
acceptance test after GNOME Shell loads the new extension version.

The Goodix touch sponge can publish a press and release between two 45 ms
polls. The driver therefore records the sequence number in `fod_state` and
treats a newly latched release as one contact when the press was missed. With
package `gts9u9`, physical contacts at the stock FOD coordinates reached the
real `EnrollDo` command through the system fprintd service. Cleanup returned
`sensor_power`, `fod_enable` and `fod_mode` to zero.

Those calls returned the same `-1, 0, 0` sequence as the earlier tokenless
harness and produced no template. This proves the complete desktop-to-touch-
to-BAUTH path, but not secure capture. Stock sends `Challenge` and a
Gatekeeper-signed `Hat_OP` before `EnrollInit`, then follows the interactive
opcode 4/5/87/6 loop with controls 87 and 80. The production driver does not
yet supply such a token or implement that complete loop. No fingerprint image,
template or Android authentication token has been copied from the device.

The command-13 envelope has since been reproduced field for field from the
stock gateway rather than as a zero-filled raw command. It contains the packed
69-byte Android hardware-auth token at offset 4, a selector at 73, up to 1024
bytes of optional payload at 77, its length at 1101 and the 60-byte challenge
record at 1105. Command 19 returns that challenge record at output offset 8.
The bridge now has typed calls for both commands.

The distinction changes the diagnostic result. A completely empty command-13
body still returns 62, but a freshly generated challenge plus a HAT carrying
the correct challenge ID and no HMAC reaches the authentication check and is
rejected with secure-world code 28. Thus 62 was an invalid challenge envelope,
not proof of a parsed but unsigned HAT. Code 28 is the first direct evidence
that the remaining pre-capture boundary is a legitimately signed hardware
authentication token. The test generated no credential and deliberately did
not import one from Android.

## Gatekeeper authorization and the complete capture transaction

The remaining HAT boundary is now implemented without Android credentials.
Ubuntu creates a random, root-only Gatekeeper identity, re-enrols that same
secret into Samsung's `skeymast` instance for each QTEE session, verifies the
current BAUTH challenge and receives a signed 69-byte HAT. Before verification,
`skeymast` command `0x203`, dualfp command 15 and control 49 provision the
target-bound HMAC key entirely inside TrustZone. `Hat_OP` now returns zero and
`EnrollInit` returns zero; neither a user password nor an Android PIN, HAT or
template is read.

The response layout of command 3 was also corrected from the stock gateway.
Its real opcode is output word zero; timeout is at `+8`, function status at
`+12`, and the three enrolment metrics at `+16/+20/+24` with progress and
remaining reordered by the gateway. A physical capture now follows the
measured sequence `4 → 5 → 87 → 6/0`, closes with `EnrollFinal` even on
BAD_QUALITY 39, and starts the next transaction with `EnrollInit`. This avoids
the old permanent `0x80000000` sentinel after one rejected image.

Opcode 5 uses control 87 with one byte of input and control 80 with four;
opcode 87 uses control 87 with one. The old bridge had mistaken those fields
for response capacities. Static analysis of `TeeProxy::ControlOp` and
`BAuth_Control_OP` proves that the third pointer and following length are
copied into the command-12 input payload. For control 80, Samsung fills that
four-byte input with `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/temp`; Ubuntu exposes the
same tenths-of-a-degree value through `sm5714-battery/temp`. The reversed
framing made control 80 return 51 and is corrected in `gts9u26`. The earlier
98.7% estimate is superseded below.

The first physical `gts9u26` run then exposed the remaining value mismatch.
One UI's live optical-capture trace prints `tfd 2 0 1` at NOTIFY_DOWN and the
following capture step. With its override field clear, control 87 receives the
first byte: **2 (finger pressed)**. Ubuntu had sent zero. That still allowed a
few images through, but after repeated quality retries the trustlet terminated
the partially populated enrolment with result 70. The production path and the
self-test now send the measured pressed state 2.

## Full-coverage capture and the HwVault boundary

The 2026-08-26 Ubuntu tests establish the following:

- fprintd's `ProtectSystem=strict` originally prevented saving the new local
  Gatekeeper state. Adding `StateDirectory=gts9u-fingerprint` permits just its
  private state directory, alongside the stock `fprint` directory. The new
  directory is root-only (0700); the 99-byte state file is 0600. The obsolete
  copy in fprintd's per-user print directory was removed after the replacement
  was present; no Android credential was involved.
- Real captures complete `4 → 5 → 87 → 6 → 0`. Opcode 63 is an acquired/progress
  callback, not a missing control request. The bounded loop now handles it.
- The first metric is increasing coverage; the third is accepted-sample count,
  not samples remaining. A run reached 17 accepted samples and coverage 100.
  The timeout now measures 90 seconds of inactivity between transactions, not
  the total duration of enrolment. Rejected samples still close with Final
  before starting the next Init.
- Result 70 was temporarily treated as a retry in the deployed `gts9u20`
  experiment. Stock `enrollDo` treats it as an error, so `gts9u21` restores that
  behaviour. Only the stock recoverable results 39/41 are retried; a fatal
  result must not be hidden by a simultaneous retry code from Final.
- At full coverage, EnrollDo returned result 71 with zero template bytes.
  EnrollFinal returned zero but no template. Static analysis follows this to
  `encode_each_templ_ver3 → getTemplateEncryptionKey → HwVaultHal_deriveKey`.
  Result 71 is a key-derivation failure, never a successful enrolment.

The stock gateway extracts the **encrypted template from EnrollDo** at
`+0x1c`, using length `+0x22601c`, maximum `0x226000`, in an output of
`0x230024` bytes. EnrollFinal's optional `0xa000`-byte payload is bitmap/debug
output and must not become an `FpPrint`. Package `gts9u21` validates and copies
only a successful terminal EnrollDo template, preserves it across Final's
shared-buffer overwrite, and publishes it only if Final also succeeds.
It does not copy Final bitmap data or log any template bytes.

`scripts/test-el721-enroll-wire.sh` provides 11 offline synthetic tests:
successful copying, empty/max/oversized/overflow lengths, short/long/null
responses, key failure, intermediate opcodes and partial coverage. These pass
in the ARM64 build environment; they do not substitute for real enrol/verify.
They also pass with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. AddressSanitizer under the
emulated build environment exited without a diagnostic, so no ASan pass is
claimed. The ARM64 `gts9u21` package built successfully and was installed on
the tablet; libfprint enumeration, Prepare and close passed without a capture
or reboot. It has since been superseded by the integrated `gts9u22` package
documented in the latest checkpoint below.

### HwVault investigation (no Android state imported)

Samsung's signed `hwvault.b00`–`b08` were read from the tablet's APNHLOS firmware
partition, mounted read-only. The assembled 1,101,912-byte TA loads and unloads
successfully via QTEE. The firmware remains a local, ignored artifact and is
not distributed by this repository. Loading it alone is not sufficient:
its `get_derived_key` explicitly reads cached credential index 11, then derives
the requested key for the caller. Android's live reference logs show that same
index. No cached credential or Android vault file was read.

Static analysis identified commands `0x271b` (generate a wrapped HwVault root)
and `0x271c` (load one into the TA). A bounded generation diagnostic returned
status **9936** and no wrapped bytes, so it performed no SetRoot and saved no
file. That result originally suggested that Ubuntu needed its own StrongBox
root. Later One UI tracing disproved the premise: the fingerprint service does
not generate a new root during normal startup. It restores existing,
authenticated K250A credentials into each fresh HwVault instance. The failed
generator remains useful negative evidence, but it is no longer the path being
implemented.

### K250A transport and authenticated credential exchange

Samsung's GPL K250A driver has now been ported to the mainline 7.2 kernel. The
shipping board connects the secure element to QUP SE10 I2C at address `0x23`
and powers it from PM8550VS-G LDO2 at 1.8 V. The boot-compatible DTB already
contains that controller but marks it disabled. To avoid another ABL bootloop,
the module applies a reversible live-device-tree changeset, instantiates the
controller and client only while loaded, and restores `status = "disabled"`
on removal. It drives the dedicated LDO through the public RPMh interface.
No replacement DTB or persistent firmware state is involved.

The signed module was exercised on the tablet under kernel lockdown. Load,
open/power, unload and live-DT rollback all succeeded. `CORE_OPEN` returned
`9000`, establishing end-to-end RPMh, GENI I2C and ISO7816 T=1 transport. The
module deliberately returns `ENODEV` for the absent reset GPIO, matching the
stock X910 DT and driver behaviour instead of simulating a reset by cycling
power.

The authenticated K250A exchange has since been reproduced completely; see the
latest checkpoint below. No Android file, PIN or userspace credential was read,
imported or changed.

### SPSS userspace boot coordination

The clean SPSS transport test proved that `qcom_spss`, GLINK, SPCOM and all six
`sec_nvm` service channels work. One UI's successful sequence has an additional
process, `spdaemon`, between SPSS boot and Keymaster use. Static analysis of Samsung's
`libspcom.so` found that this is not coordinated through `/dev/spcom`: the
library opens `/dev/spss_utils` and uses the exact legacy event ABI
`WAIT_FOR_EVENT`, `SIGNAL_EVENT` and `IS_EVENT_SIGNALED`. The event IDs are 0
(`pil_called`), 1 (`nvm_ready`) and 2 (`spu_ready`). The previously ported
SPCOM source even declared `spss_utils` as a soft dependency, but that second
driver had not been included.

The experimental kernel now packages a mainline adaptation of Samsung's GPL
`spss_utils` driver. It preserves the stock IOCTL numbers, structures, status
values and duplicate-signal behaviour, creates `/dev/spss_utils`, and ties
power-up/power-down event reset to the actual SPSS `remoteproc` lifecycle. The
bootloader-sensitive DTB remains untouched: `qcom_spss` publishes both
userspace bridge devices below its dynamically created remote processor.
Samsung's downstream IAR/CMAC handoff is not emulated because it requires a
hypervisor memory-assignment API absent from this mainline platform; attempts
to use it fail explicitly instead of reporting a false secure handoff.

A delayed manual launch also exposed an ordering constraint. SPSS advertises
`cryptoapp`, `sp_keymaster` and `sp_nvm` shortly after GLINK comes up, and its
production firmware no longer completed a symmetric OPEN requested much later
by `spdaemon`. Predefining those application channels in SPCOM was tested and
then rejected: the stock SM-X910 DT defines only `sp_kernel` and `sp_ssr`.
Android instead starts `sec_nvm` and `spdaemon` as part of the same boot
sequence. Ubuntu must preserve that split and coordinate userspace with SPSS
startup, rather than changing the kernel's channel ownership model.

The modules compile cleanly against Linux 7.2, pass `checkpatch` with no errors
or warnings and are signed by the same kernel build key. Subsequent hardware
work established the shared `qcom,sp-hlos` DMA-BUF heap and the complete SPSS
startup path. More importantly, tracing the consumer showed that generating a
new HwVault root was the wrong success criterion; the normal fingerprint path
is the authenticated credential restore documented next.

## Authenticated HwVault restore and integrated fprintd

This early 2026-09-02 checkpoint established authenticated transport, not usable
template encryption. The later full-coverage test exposed a hidden cache failure;
see the latest checkpoint below. Its original claim that the encryption gap was
closed was incorrect.

- Reverse engineering Samsung's `libese-grdg.so` established the namespace
  selector in the K250A GET APDU: `P1=1` for persistent credentials and `P1=0`
  for ordinary credentials. One UI restores persistent indices 0 and 1, then
  ordinary index 11.
- Ubuntu now selects the `SECURE_NVM` applet, obtains a fresh nonce, asks
  HwVault command `0x2714` to sign each GET, reads the encrypted credential and
  response authenticator from K250A, and returns both to command `0x2715` for
  verification and caching. The measured payloads are 353 bytes (index 0),
  2,533 bytes (index 1), and 185 bytes (index 11); every HwVault status is zero.
- `libfprint` retains that restored HwVault object for the complete EL721
  session. A tablet self-test then completed BAUTH `Prepare` with transport,
  result, function status and opcode all zero, reported bootstrap 76/model 88,
  loaded the optical calibration blob and exited `PASS`.
- The real systemd sandbox grants only `/dev/tee0` and `/dev/k250a` in addition
  to its existing policy. `fprintd-list agcar` detects `EgisTec EL721 UDFPS`
  through the installed package and exits zero. No fingerprint is currently
  enrolled.
- The 11 synthetic encrypted-enrolment protocol tests pass in the full ARM64
  package build. Installed package:
  `1:1.94.7+tod1-0ubuntu5~24.04.8+gts9u22`; SHA-256:
  `c8272978855f837f98e36de06e08b37acfb6410efbe6c4c3cacabf11760e1ab9`.

The proprietary signed TAs and device calibration remain user-supplied,
hash-validated local firmware and are not distributed by this repository. The
restore uses only authenticated GET operations against the tablet's secure
element; it does not import Android files, a PIN or a fingerprint template.

The 99% estimate recorded at this checkpoint was premature and is withdrawn.
Physically enrolling a fresh finger into an encrypted template, verifying the
same and a different finger, and validating cancellation, lockout, PAM/GDM and
the lock-screen FOD overlay are substantial outstanding acceptance tests. See
the current assessment at the top; protocol infrastructure is not proof of a
working biometric feature.

The latest physical run also established that the Goodix firmware normally
publishes one `released` record rather than separate press/release records.
The driver now consumes the first isolated release after enabling FOD as a
stale arming event and accepts subsequent releases as real contacts. The user
confirmed that the target appears correctly on repeated touches. Captures
reached 96% coverage and 16 accepted samples before the incorrectly framed
control path returned EnrollDo result 70. Samsung maps 70 to its system-failure
state, so the temporary retry was removed rather than hiding or looping the
failure. The corrected `gts9u26` package is the next physical enrolment test.

## Press-capable Goodix path and persistent test reports

The current kernel no longer waits for the firmware's late dedicated FOD
release gesture. Its first ordinary coordinate press inside
`854 2732 994 2872` publishes `pressed`, suppresses that contact from the
desktop, and publishes `released` when the slot ends. This starts secure
capture while the finger is still covering the optical reader.

Once userspace observes that press-capable protocol it permanently disables
the older release-only fallback for the current operation. The firmware can
publish a second dedicated release after the synthetic coordinate release;
treating it as another contact caused one no-finger capture per real touch,
many result-39 quality retries and eventually fatal result 70. Package
`gts9u29` contains this fix, uses the trustlet's measured 17 enrolment stages
and emits one compact aggregate sample record for diagnostics.

Tab Companion 1.1.3 exposes the bounded test under Info. A completed run is a
normal right-index enrolment; timeout, Stop and Escape cancel without saving a
partial template. Live coverage, accepted samples, retries and the secure
result are shown in the window. The latest report is always:

```text
~/.local/state/tab-companion/fingerprint-tests/latest.jsonl
```

Timestamped siblings retain earlier runs. Records contain timing and aggregate
result fields only; raw images, template contents, HATs and vault credentials
never leave their existing secure boundaries.

The press-capable kernel is now a required part of this feature branch, so
userspace no longer treats isolated legacy RELEASE events as captures. The
firmware can emit those events while FOD mode is starting; accepting them
caused a false first stage before any touch. Per-contact and per-sample
aggregate records use journal level MESSAGE so the persistent test report sees
them without enabling global libfprint debug output.

The first fully instrumented run contained 31 genuine PRESS captures: 30
returned quality result 39, one reached 2% coverage/one accepted sample, and
the next capture exhausted the trustlet's 30-retry budget with result 70.
Every matching RELEASE had `capture=0`, confirming that duplicate capture is
fixed. Package `gts9u31` tested a 250 ms press-settle interval and recorded
press coordinates plus actual hold time. The follow-up run placed every long
contact around the physical centre `(924, 2802)` and still returned result 39,
so neither alignment nor settling explains the regression.

The earlier high-yield runs processed the sample after RELEASE. The sensor
acquires while covered, but that paired Samsung event is the point at which
its buffered optical image is ready for the trustlet. Package `gts9u32`
therefore captures on exactly the first RELEASE following a real PRESS.
Isolated startup releases and the later duplicate release have no preceding
live contact and cannot consume a sample.

## Deterministic 62% boundary

Two release-timed diagnostics accepted exactly 10 physical samples, reached
62% coverage and returned result 70 on the following contact. They failed at
53 and 64 seconds respectively, ruling out both a fixed session timeout and a
quality-retry budget. Tab Companion 1.1.4 retained the terminal aggregate in
the second report as intended.

The `CAPTURE_FINGER_LEAVE` message in Samsung's service trace is followed by
control 76, but that operation requests the 1024-byte `adlg` diagnostic blob;
it is not a finger-state transition. Calling it with no response capacity only
produces the already-known non-fatal shape status 51 and cannot repair result
70. Package `gts9u34` therefore removes that probe and records every EnrollDo
step as `opcode:result:status` in the compact per-sample journal line. This
will show whether the 62% failure occurs before sensor capture, during an
intermediate opcode, or in the enrolment algorithm's terminal reply.

The resulting trace isolated the boundary to
`4 -> 5 -> 87 -> 63 -> result 70`. Static analysis of Samsung's current
`libsfp_sensor.so` shows that opcode 63 emits the ordinary enrolment-progress
callback and returns zero, after which stock `enrollDo` immediately calls the
TA again. The missing distinction was earlier: stock obtains opcode 4, arms
the sensor interrupt and waits for a physical finger-down before the next
EnrollDo. Ubuntu instead entered the whole loop after RELEASE, so the TA's
milestone continuation ran without a finger and aborted.

Package `gts9u35` preserves that asynchronous boundary. Each EnrollInit is
followed immediately by exactly one EnrollDo that must return opcode 4. The
driver then waits for the kernel's paired PRESS, completes `5 -> 87 -> 6/0`
while the finger is present, closes with EnrollFinal, starts the next Init and
arms its opcode 4 before returning to the poller. RELEASE now only clears the
contact latch. This matches the order in the successful One UI trace without
requiring Android state or a reboot. The ARM64 build and all 11 protocol tests
pass; package SHA-256 is
`edf390dd414e83ab2d0159e91eaa0fdf8d1a893f476b176cf69fbe9957f61c23`.
It was installed live over `gts9u34` while fprintd was inactive.

The first `gts9u35` diagnostic proved the pre-arm path but rejected long
contacts: 12 quality retries, four accepted rapid lift-offs and then result 70
at 8% coverage. Every accepted image occurred when RELEASE arrived while the
press-time EnrollDo sequence was still running. Thus opcode 4 must remain
pre-armed, while this Ubuntu touch/sensor path still requires the paired
release before consuming the buffered image.

Package `gts9u36` splits one secure transaction across the contact. PRESS
resumes the pre-armed opcode 4 and handles only opcodes 5 and 87 plus their
measured controls. The driver then leaves that transaction open. Its paired
RELEASE resumes EnrollDo to obtain opcode 6/0, closes with EnrollFinal, starts
the next EnrollInit and pre-arms opcode 4 again. The saved compact trace
reconstructs all three pre-release opcodes across the asynchronous boundary.
The ARM64 build and all 11 wire tests pass; package SHA-256 is
`0f107c9585221cf7b42ef98a34e88f4ea86d00e2a64ea1d6990df7af47443881`.
It was installed live while fprintd and both FOD endpoints were idle.

## Optical exposure investigation (2026-09-02)

The `gts9u36` physical run returned 30 quality retries, three accepted samples,
6% coverage and fatal result 70 after about 60 seconds. This falsifies the
previous claim that waiting after opcode 87 would fix the image. The user
confirmed that there is no screen protector and enrollment works in One UI.

Read-only analysis of the locally supplied signed `dualfp` image established
the following (addresses are virtual addresses in this particular build):

- `fp_enroll_state_handler` calls `fpsec_do_get_image_only` at `0x1c954`,
  before returning opcode 87 from `ESTATE_GET_TSP_STATUS` at `0x1e21c`.
  Delaying after 87 does not delay acquisition.
- `do_enroll_stub` at `0x17198` converts an already-fatal internal result 70
  into opcode 63, latches a flag, and returns 70 on the next call via
  `0x16fc0`. The host's callback handling does not cause that abort.
- Internal abort paths include repeated quality failures and
  `check_phone_case` (`0x27504`), which aggregates an optical metric over
  eight observations. This does not establish that the tablet has a case or
  protector; it rules out treating every 63/70 as a coverage milestone.
- Control 87 (`do_extra_control`, `0x186a0`) only calls
  `fp_set_finger_off` for input byte **1**. Both 0 and 2 are no-ops, so the
  earlier claim that changing 0 to 2 repaired the secure state was unfounded.

The successful One UI reference consistently reports `HBM=385` before each
contact. Samsung's `GTS9U_ANA38407_AMSA46AS02.dat` maps platform level 385 to
WRDISBV **1623 / 634 cd/m2** and HBM WRDISBV 2047 to **900 cd/m2**. The port
was using 2047 and incorrectly documenting it as fingerprint 650 cd/m2. The
panel correction uses 1623, exposes it read-only as `fod_brightness`, and
adjusts GNOME's shade estimate to 634. Actual overexposure is a hypothesis to
test, not a result established by these tables.

`gts9u37` removes the disproven split-at-87 wait, restores the stock press-time
transaction, records monotonic capture duration, and removes enrollment-only
gating from verification contacts. No TA, calibration or matcher threshold is
modified. The kernel change leaves the DTB and kernel configuration identical
to the previous booted build. Only the Ubuntu boot image needs replacement;
Android, vendor_boot, init_boot, dtbo, vbmeta and the module tree stay untouched.

The ARM64 package build and all 11 encrypted-wire tests pass. Kernel
checkpatch reports no errors or warnings. The corrected kernel booted Ubuntu
successfully, `fod_brightness` reports 1623, the overlay is active, and HBM
returns to zero while idle. No systemd units failed after this reboot.

- Ubuntu `boot.img` SHA-256:
  `5269f2fd1bf98b81f92559ae4502dfd2d6b3fd8334efa63203d1736573c7544b`.
- `gts9u37` package SHA-256:
  `982ca2de7537566c0c05d4a51f8e6e6db19fc629a782d39abe9a32a1d3c4afec`.
- Verified previous boot and overlay are retained on the tablet in
  `/var/lib/gts9u-kernel-backups/pre-el721-fod385`.

Physical enrollment and same/different-finger verification remain outstanding;
the boot and build checks do not establish improved capture quality.

## Full coverage and hidden StrongBox failure (2026-09-02)

The subsequent `gts9u37` physical test, 17:19:25–17:20:11 UTC, accepted **17
samples**, reached **100% coverage**, and needed only **two quality retries**.
This supports the corrected optical exposure/press-time capture path. However,
the last EnrollDo returned **72**, with **zero encrypted template bytes**;
EnrollFinal returned zero. `fprintd-list` confirms no saved fingerprint. This is
not the earlier result-70 capture abort and must not be counted as enrollment.

Static analysis and a bounded, non-biometric Ubuntu diagnostic now establish
the failure chain:

- `dualfp:getTemplateEncryptionKey` maps HwVault result **7** to EL721 **72**
  at `0x2f60`; other derivation errors map to 71.
- HwVault `get_derived_key` requests cached credential 11 (`0xb258`).
  `get_cached_cred` returns 7 when that cache entry is absent (`0xb054–0xb0a4`).
- HwVault `VERIFY_GET` returns status zero and credential bytes even if its
  internal `set_cached_cred` call fails: the handler ignores that return code
  at `0x9c18–0x9c1c`. The previous success check therefore gave a false positive.
- The existing One UI trace verifies persistent indices 0/1 with
  `HV_TAG_UPDATE_CRED=1`, and ordinary index 11 with zero. Ubuntu incorrectly
  always sent zero. Correcting this gives confirmed cache status zero for 0/1,
  but does **not** fix index 11.
- The firmware's textual diagnostic TLVs (`0x02002710`) explicitly report
  `strongbox_unwrap err -64`, then index-11 cache status **9936**, while outer
  verification remains zero. Android defines -64 as
  [`KEYMASTER_NOT_CONFIGURED`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/57b63bd35606007d7f97d2b2098aec2d150859a4/keymaster/4.0/types.hal).

`gts9u38` corrects the namespace flag and fails early unless each authenticated
GET has a matching successful cache acknowledgement. The check parses only
bounded status/log TLVs; it never exports credentials, keys or biometric bytes.
It is an error-detection guard, **not a StrongBox initialization fix**, and still
requires a successful encrypted EnrollDo before saving a print. There are 21 new
synthetic restore tests in addition to the existing 11 encrypted-wire tests.

The full ARM64 package build passed all 32 tests; the 21 restore cases also pass
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Installed package SHA-256:
`34f190026cabedbe851bff94988d83dd343fe7c660f6007551f4e7f0b8247f9e`.
The previous `gts9u37` package is retained and hash-verified on the tablet.
An actual systemd/fprintd `Claim` now rejects the known failure with explicit
cache status 9936 before enrollment starts. Sensor power and FOD HBM both return
to zero. This check does not start a capture, overwrite the user's test log,
write secure-element credentials or reboot the tablet.

The next functional work is the missing StrongBox/Keymaster initialization and
wrapped-root restore sequence, including the stock `SET_HWVAULT_ROT` step after
the authenticated GET. A successful GET or BAUTH Prepare is not sufficient
validation. No new root should be generated, no secure credential should be
replaced, and no fingerprint/Android credential should be imported. Keep the
working illumination and capture behavior unchanged while fixing this boundary.

The overall estimate remains approximately **80%**, highly uncertain: physical
capture improved materially, but encryption was previously overestimated and
matching/lock-screen use remain untested. No Android boot is needed for this
diagnosis; the reference logs and signed firmware are already available locally.

## Resident Keymaster lookup ABI (2026-09-02)

`gts9u39` fixes QSEECom `lookupTA` (loader UID 122, operation 2). Its ABI is
one input buffer, **one 32-bit architecture output and one object output**
(counts `0x1011`). Omitting the scalar output sent `0x1001`, rejected with
INVALID before looking up the name. This was incorrectly treated as a missing
TA, causing unnecessary load attempts and hiding the resident Qualcomm
`keymaster64` controller. The loader/unloader still unloads only TAs it actually
loaded; borrowing a resident controller must not unload another client's TA.

The corrected lookup finds `keymaster64`, architecture 2. Its read-only
`0x200` response is API **4.1**, TA **4.1012**, matching the saved One UI boot
trace. Normal-world access to services 150/296 is restricted and is not a
substitute for the app-loader controller. Samsung `skeymast` is a different TA;
configuring it alone does not configure Qualcomm StrongBox.

Six mocked invocation tests cover the ABI for four TA names, a missing TA and
transport failure. The full ARM64 build passes all **38 offline tests**.
Installed package SHA-256:
`2f99d9066b81a7e44348e6852e3c9fe7c081016be7738c2107621be47ef99dfa`.
The previous `gts9u38` package is retained and hash-verified on the tablet.

A real systemd/fprintd `Claim` still fails early at the encryption preflight
(cache status 9998 in the diagnostic SPU session), without starting enrollment.
This package is an ABI correction, **not an enrollment fix**. The user should
not repeat a 17-touch enrollment until credential 11 has a positive cache
acknowledgement. The capture/HBM settings and the user's test logs are unchanged.

## SPU configuration and real interrupts (2026-09-02)

Non-biometric Ubuntu diagnostics have advanced the failure boundary. No
fingerprint, PIN, new root, key-generation command or secure credential PUT was
used. The Ubuntu boot image remains the previously verified `5269f2fd…744b`;
only an Ubuntu-to-Ubuntu reboot was used to clear an earlier incomplete session.
Android was not booted. The SPU daemons use Ubuntu-private NVM backing files,
backed up before startup; Android filesystems are not mounted for these tests.

`sec_nvm` and `spdaemon` started together through the real `/dev/spss_utils`
events. `sp_keymaster` reports **v73.6.FE7DA67B**, hardware **06010000**, the same
as the saved One UI trace. No fabricated event proxy was needed.

The resident Qualcomm controller accepts:

- `0x200`: API 4.1 / TA 4.1012, read-only version query.
- `0x20d`: a 20 KiB control DMA buffer allocated from `qcom,secure-sp-tz`,
  registered with QTEE and locked through SPCOM's `sp_keymaster` channel.
  The diagnostic retains the DMA lease until an Ubuntu reboot; stopping its
  process while secure world might retain the address is not a safe cleanup.
- `0x207`: the stock 24-byte protocol negotiation request, status zero.
- `0x2116`: modern CBOR Configure with the three required OS/patch tags. Ubuntu
  uses zero values rather than claiming an Android security patch level.
  Legacy `0x116` and optional SetVersion `0x3121` return -40; stock's modern
  Configure path ignores SetVersion's failure and continues.

After configuration, the cache failure changes from 9936 (`-64`, not configured)
to 9998 (`-2`) with no working interrupt listener. The formerly stubbed listener
was a second independent omission:

- Service 87 / listener `0xb000` uses **SPL's raw protocol**, not libqisl's TLVs.
  Requests are `{command, unused, timeout_ms}` and replies `{command, status}`.
- Unknown commands, including the initial `0xdead`, receive `0xff`, as in stock.
  `0x777` waits for `/dev/qsee_ipc_irq_spss`. Replies distinguish actual IRQ
  (`0xaa`), timeout (`0xbb`), reset (`0xcc`), cancellation (`0xdd`) and I/O error
  (`0xee`). Registration or elapsed time must never fabricate an IRQ.
- The QTEE callback has two output buffers (16-byte offsets / 4-byte flag) and
  four output objects. Callback outputs have capacities but initially NULL
  addresses. Their backing storage must outlive dispatch until SUPPL_SEND;
  the diagnostic now uses callback-owned storage and returns no objects.
- A root-only, exclusive-open kernel bridge maps the stock IPCC **16:1 rising
  edge**, separate from GLINK's 16:0. It loaded with the existing kernel signature,
  and both `/proc/interrupts` and the userspace poll observed real interrupts.

The reusable listener dispatcher is included in `gts9u40` but remains behind
`EL721_QIS_DIAGNOSTIC=1`; neither the module nor the SPU initializer is enabled
automatically. The bridge lacks subsystem-reset reporting, and diagnostic waits
are capped at five seconds. These limitations are explicit, not silently treated
as successful hardware events. See
[`kernel/modules/spss-irq/README.md`](../kernel/modules/spss-irq/README.md).

Twenty-five synthetic SPL tests cover callback shapes, output-buffer lifetime,
raw replies, malformed requests, unknown commands, and timeout forwarding. They
pass UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer; kernel checkpatch reports zero errors/warnings.
The integrated dispatcher was also exercised on the tablet without enabling the
sensor or illumination. It receives two genuine IRQs and returns both to QTEE.

**Failure in that already-partially-initialized boot:** with this listener, HwVault reports
`strongbox_unwrap err -40` and cache status **9960**, despite successful outer GET
verification. Configuring Samsung `skeymast` as well does not change it. The
signed Qualcomm TA's command table does contain legacy `SB_UNWRAP` (`0x51b`),
forwarded through SPU initialization/transport; the evidence does not establish
that unwrap itself, rather than a prerequisite, rejects the request. This is the
next boundary to investigate. Encrypted enrollment and verification are still
unproven, and another physical enrollment test is not yet useful.

The complete ARM64 `gts9u40` build passes **63 offline tests** (11 enrollment,
21 HwVault, 6 lookup, 25 SPL). Installed package SHA-256:
`1c99440eec266792bfa84958f9bb430a1bde689d580a79e55321782d941ced11`.
The corrected final SPL header also rebuilds without driver warnings under
libfprint's stricter `-Wswitch-enum` flags. The normal systemd/fprintd `Claim`
retains the explicit early failure (9998 without the diagnostic listener),
instead of asking for samples and failing at the end. Prior packages remain
available for rollback. No new physical enrollment is claimed.

The standalone module's final source builds and signs successfully; its
SHA-256 is `803c3b504be4ab151ed011ab77ec66da561e55cd4fd05d90231b04a28e919653`.
Only comment formatting differs from the module exercised on the tablet.

## Clean, listener-first startup restores the encryption credential (2026-09-02)

A subsequent controlled Ubuntu-to-Ubuntu reboot removed the incomplete SPU
session. With the SPL listener registered **before the first SPU-backed crypto
request**, all three authenticated HwVault restores now report an explicit
successful `set_cached_cred` acknowledgement, including ordinary credential
**11** (`persistent=0`, `ret=0`). The previous 9960 failure is absent. The final
signed IRQ module described above is the one exercised in this boot.

The working diagnostic order is:

1. Start Ubuntu's `sec_nvm` and `spdaemon` together and wait for SP applications.
2. Load the IRQ bridge and register the real SPL listener, retaining its owner.
3. Look up resident `keymaster64`; query `0x200`, negotiate with the stock
   24-byte `0x207`, and bind/retain the 20 KiB DMA buffer with `0x20d`.
4. Send the stock date-support query and optional SetVersion, then modern
   Configure with the existing conservative zero OS/patch tags.
5. Restore HwVault credentials 0/1/11 and require positive cache acknowledgements.

The IRQ bridge may be loaded before starting the SPU daemons; the important
ordering is that the listener must be ready before deferred crypto initialization.
The successful first restore generated multiple genuine SPL interrupts, unlike
the two-interrupt failure in the incomplete session. Static analysis shows that
normal-world `0x20d` only binds the buffer; the first SPU-backed operation performs
additional initialization. A partially completed exchange explains the observed
order dependence, but the precise remote failure state has not been proven.

Two actual systemd/fprintd `Claim` calls succeeded with `gts9u40`, including one
after restarting fprintd. The independent listener/DMA owner remained running;
the driver could borrow HwVault and restore its cache across service lifetimes.
After release, sensor power, panel FOD mode and touch FOD enable were all zero.
No enrollment was started and the previous physical-test JSONL was unchanged.

**A new physical enrollment test is now useful.** Success still requires an
encrypted template and `enroll-completed`, not just 17 accepted samples or a
successful Claim. Same/different-finger verification, production startup/reset
handling and lock-screen integration remain outstanding. The overall estimate
is approximately **85%**, with substantial uncertainty until those tests pass.

This is a prepared diagnostic session, not persistent boot integration. The
transient listener/DMA owner must remain alive until a controlled Ubuntu reboot;
do not kill it, unload SPSS or start a second initializer. After a reboot the
ordered setup must be repeated before asking the user to enroll. No Android boot,
new HwVault root, secure credential PUT or Android-private-state import was used.

## First encrypted enrollment and persisted identity fix (2026-09-02)

The next physical test completed at 19:14:09 UTC: **17 accepted samples, 100%
coverage, five quality retries**, and an **847,142-byte encrypted template**.
The client reported `enroll-completed`, and a separate `fprintd-list` confirmed
the right-index print on disk. Sensor power and both FOD controls returned to
zero. This establishes encrypted enrollment, not successful recognition.

A subsequent bounded, no-finger verification failed at `IdentifyInit` with 31.
The stored blob has the expected `FPV32000` header and matching big-endian length;
its contents were not exported or decrypted outside the TA. Review exposed a
separate driver defect: `fpi_print_generate_user_id()` returns a fresh random ID
on every call. The driver called it for every enrollment transaction and again
for verification, and stored only `(uay)` (slot, ciphertext). The signed TA
compares the supplied 256-byte identity against the identity in the decrypted
template (`decode_each_templ_ver3`, comparison at `0x13260–0x132b0`). Regenerating
the identifier cannot reproduce that identity.

`gts9u41` generates the enrollment ID once, retains it through all captures,
stores `(suay)` (identity, slot, ciphertext), and loads the saved ID for matching.
It explicitly rejects legacy prints that have no saved ID, requesting enrollment
again; it does not bypass the TA comparison or invent an identity. Mixed-identity
galleries are rejected rather than submitted under the first print's identity;
multi-print identification remains integration work. The first test is therefore
one new enrollment, followed by same-finger and different-finger verification.
Successful recognition after this correction still needs physical validation.

Ten offline tests cover persisted identity roundtrip, backing-storage lifetime,
legacy rejection and size/slot validation, alongside the previous 63 protocol
tests. Tab Companion 1.1.5 adds an explicit verification mode, preserving the
saved print and distinguishing a non-match from a transport/reader error.
Sixteen offline client tests cover status parsing, retries, cancellation,
timeout and late delivery of the final result. Zero process exit status alone
is never counted as a successful verification.

All **73** offline driver tests pass with UBSan and strict enum warnings; the
ARM64 incremental build passed without compiler warnings. The installed
gts9u41 package SHA-256 is
`3643f752873f065e164b0f394c6809c0689a2a3a16ec94f77970177d6413d8ae`.
An installed-device check confirms explicit legacy rejection before illumination,
with all three sensor/FOD controls idle afterward. The old encrypted print was
backed up with root-only permissions and remained byte-for-byte unchanged during
deployment. No new physical test is claimed here. The live SPU owner was retained.

## Verification waits for contact, not a byte-12 false rejection (2026-09-02)

The user re-enrolled with `gts9u41`: 17 accepted samples, 100% coverage and an
848,262-byte encrypted template, with successful EnrollDo/Final. IdentifyInit
now accepts the persisted identity. However, verification returned terminal
`verify-no-match` about 177 ms after starting, before any physical contact.

The independent bounded no-contact probe and the signed TA's `run_identify_do`
agree on the cause: IdentifyDo's next operation is at byte **0**, not byte 12.
The initial words `{4, 0, 0xffffffff, 0, 0, 0}` mean **wait for contact**, not
completion. Byte 16 is the score and byte **20** the matched slot; exchanging
those also prevented reliable match reporting. The decoder now handles this
layout separately, bounds opaque updates and copies them only for a completed
successful match. It never treats an update or score alone as authentication.

`gts9u42` arms IdentifyDo once, requires operation 4, then waits for a fresh
physical PRESS edge. Held contact and RELEASE cannot initiate extra captures.
A bounded synchronous stock-style capture sequence follows the press; Final
must succeed before reporting a match. Quality retries reinitialize and rearm
the transaction for another press. The existing 90-second inactivity watchdog
and cancellation remain in effect; no timeout was artificially extended to
conceal the decoder defect.

Thirty synthetic IdentifyDo/contact tests cover the observed wait regression,
slot versus score, auxiliary versus operation fields, retries, no-match,
malformed buffers, update ownership/bounds and all contact-gating combinations.
All **103** driver tests pass with UBSan and strict enum warnings; the ARM64
build has no compiler warnings. The 16 Companion tests still pass. Installed
package SHA-256:
`eca9a15dce248619dad0bd3f39915b4d2c5f95db712542c3e748e09080415a73`.

Two real fprintd verification sessions, including one after restarting only
fprintd, each waited **over 20 seconds without contact or any rejection**.
Sensor power, panel FOD and touch FOD remained enabled throughout, and all
returned to zero after VerifyStop/Release. The newly enrolled print was backed
up root-only and remained byte-for-byte unchanged; Companion's physical-test
log was not overwritten. The temporary debug override was removed and the
independent SPU listener/DMA owner was retained without a reboot.

Next physical test: Companion Info → **Verificar huella guardada** → start,
then use the enrolled finger. If it matches, repeat using a different finger
and require rejection. No re-enrollment is needed. **Recognition is not yet
validated**; the overall estimate remains roughly 90%, with persistent startup,
same/different-finger validation and lock-screen/UX integration outstanding.

## Recognition confirmed and first GNOME integration (2026-09-02)

The physical tests at 20:44–20:45 UTC confirm three matches with result/final
0/0 and slot 3, and four rejected attempts with result/final 32/0 and slot 0.
The user identifies these as the enrolled finger versus other fingers. All
captures followed actual PRESS edges. This is functional evidence on this
device, not a statistical false-accept/reject evaluation.

`gts9u43` reports the terminal **32 + operation 0 + slot 0** tuple as an ordinary
non-match (`FPI_MATCH_FAIL`), not `verify-unknown-error`. IdentifyFinal must still
succeed first. Other secure errors, retries, intermediate operations and
contradictory nonzero slots are not reclassified. Eight new synthetic cases
raise the driver suite to **111 passing tests**, with UBSan/strict enum warnings;
the ARM64 build is warning-free. Companion's 16 tests also pass. Installed
package SHA-256:
`53547a9e7276868cbc0c77af1df2806aea1334ae424ff09befe72d1bd73a9566`.
A post-install no-contact verification waited 20.249 seconds and cancelled
cleanly. The new rejection wording still needs a physical different-finger test.

The installed GNOME/GDM configuration already enables both fingerprint and
password authentication. `/etc/pam.d/gdm-fingerprint` uses `pam_fprintd.so`, while
`gdm-password` and `common-auth` retain the separate password path. All three
files remained byte-for-byte unchanged during this update. No broad PAM
modification or fingerprint-only login policy was introduced.

Device package **2.39**, overlay **8**, removes the accelerometer dependency.
It asynchronously reads Mutter's applied DisplayConfig transform and selects
the built-in `DSI-1`, not whichever external display is primary. Thirty-six
offline geometry cases cover all eight transforms at three scales, invalid
inputs, panel selection and monitor offsets. The shade is non-reactive and
excluded from the input region; only the target retains its touch guard.
Package SHA-256:
`6a3c3cd05d91f739c1eb56632174fd163a5523ed3f4c8b84eecc73802649d2be`.

These geometry changes are installed on disk but **require a GNOME logout/login
to load**, because imported extension modules remain cached. No logout/reboot
was forced. At **21:16:16 UTC**, the user instead successfully unlocked the
existing GNOME session using the enrolled finger. The journal identifies
gnome-shell as the activating client, a successful secure match and the
`gdm-fingerprint` PAM conversation; logind then reports the session unlocked.
Companion's previous test log is unchanged, so this was a native system unlock,
not an app test. It used the new gts9u43 driver but the still-cached v7 overlay.
Native GNOME also logged a disposed UserVerifierProxy warning afterward, worth
checking on repeated locks; this does not invalidate the observed unlock.
The next tests are a logout/password login to load v8, then landscape screen
lock, wrong-finger rejection, password fallback and repeated unlocks. Native
GNOME handles the PAM feedback; this first step does not add near-sensor text.

Remaining work is explicit: illuminate only during contact (dim icon at rest),
coordinate keyboard overlap with the driver's touch suppression, validate actual
rotations and suspend, provide the target in GDM's separate greeter session,
and replace the transient SPU setup with a safe production startup/reset path.
Merely hiding a target over the keyboard is insufficient: the kernel currently
suppresses ordinary touches inside the enabled FOD rectangle. No UI workaround
claims that interaction is solved yet. The saved print and the live SPU owner
were preserved; no new enrollment is required.

## Repeated-unlock closed connection and retry lifecycle (2026-09-02)

After logging in again, overlay **8** was confirmed active. Native unlock then
accepted the enrolled finger, rejected other fingers twice with secure result
32, and accepted the enrolled finger again. Subsequent repeated lock/resume
attempts left the unlock prompt unusable, while quick settings, volume and SSH
still responded. At inspection, fprintd was inactive, sensor power/FOD/touch
FOD were all zero and the overlay's Visible property was false.

The installed Ubuntu GNOME code identifies the immediate UI failure: each
`UnlockDialog._ensureAuthPrompt()` reset calls `ShellUserVerifier.cancel()`,
whose synchronous cancellation throws **Gio.IOErrorEnum.CLOSED** before
`clear()` runs. The stale verifier is therefore retained and every new gesture
throws again. This is not evidence of a GPU or secure-processor hang. The
preflight still succeeded after the suspensions without enabling illumination.

Device **2.40**, overlay **9**, adds a narrow cancellation guard to the existing
extension. It delegates to GNOME's original cancel method; only a CLOSED error
with a demonstrably closed verifier connection triggers GNOME's own `clear()`.
Other errors propagate. It never reports authentication success, unlocks the
session or changes PAM policy. Disabling the extension restores the original
method if its wrapper still owns it. Seven offline cases and a real private
GJS/GIO closed-connection test pass. The running v8 session still needs a
logout/login before the guard is active; recovery of the real stuck dialog is
**not yet validated**.

A separate driver contract violation was also found in the earlier greeter
quality retries: `fpi_device_verify_report` asserted because the driver tried
to report multiple results for one action. libfprint requires report **then
complete**, even for retry errors. `gts9u44` powers down/cleans up that action,
reports one retry and completes it with NULL completion error. fprintd owns the
next action, instead of the driver silently rearming the already-reported one.
Two stubbed notification-lifecycle tests exercise five consecutive actions each
for Verify and Identify, bringing the C suite to **113 passes** with UBSan.
The 36 geometry and 16 Companion cases also still pass. Physical repeated
quality retries and repeated lock/suspend remain required tests.

Installed SHA-256 values:

- libfprint gts9u44: `3140de81227db20e43e066f317ddac3c270e51178eb6f92ee90254ab9b633b0f`.
- Device 2.40: `ce06a231c2e86c2c8528c5c2033d444f516720a01fb17a58e44990c0861c2c35`.

For non-destructive recovery, a new GDM greeter was opened using its normal
CreateTransientDisplay interface, leaving the original session locked and its
applications running. It still requires the user's password; no unlock signal
or authentication bypass was used. No reboot, GDM restart or SPU-owner restart
was performed. The saved print and three PAM files remained byte-for-byte
unchanged. This regression means repeat-unlock stability must not be described
as complete despite the earlier successful single unlocks.

## Touch-to-light icon and repeated-unlock validation (2026-09-03)

The user returned to the desktop, logged in again, and the running extension
was confirmed **v9 ACTIVE**. They subsequently report repeated successful
tests in several rotations, without recurrence of the stuck prompt. This is
useful physical validation of the applied-transform positioning and repeated
unlock path, not a claim of exhaustive suspend/reset reliability.

**gts9u45 + device 2.41 / overlay 10** implement the requested resting icon:

- Arming enables the sensor and Goodix contact detection but leaves panel
  `fod_mode=0`. A root-owned `/run/gts9u-fingerprint/active` lease tells Shell
  to display the installed `auth-fingerprint-symbolic` icon. It contains only
  an expiry time, never an identity, template or authentication result.
- The lease is renewed every second, expires after three seconds and is
  removed by normal action cleanup and fprintd's stop/crash cleanup. Its
  directory is root-writable (0755), the file publicly readable (0644).
  No writable sysfs permissions or authentication policy are loosened.
- A real Goodix PRESS enables optical HBM; Shell replaces the icon with the
  white circle and compensation shade. Normal touch/click events are not
  required, because the controller suppresses them in the sensing region.
- Capture waits **at least 180 ms after the panel command completes**. The
  nonblocking timer leaves cancellation responsive while allowing the 50 ms
  Shell observer and compositor frames to present the target. This is a
  conservative settling interval, **not a compositor-ready acknowledgement**;
  physical capture quality under load still needs validation.
- Early release cancels the pending capture and turns off HBM. Completed
  enrollment samples also turn it off before waiting for the next press;
  holding a finger cannot trigger another sample. Verify completion/retry,
  cancellation and errors use the existing full cleanup path. If suspend has
  disabled Goodix FOD, the action ends instead of silently rearming it.
- The waiting icon uses the same already-tested physical geometry. The shade
  is hidden while waiting, including if Shell tries to remap top-chrome actors.
  Actual panel HBM remains authoritative for compensation, including with an
  older driver, so a stale lease cannot leave a permanently shaded desktop.

Validation: **120 C tests** pass under UBSan, plus 36 geometry, seven closed-GDM
recovery, 13 visual lease, seven mocked overlay transition and 16 Companion
tests. The ARM64 build completed without warnings. Mock actor tests validate
state transitions, not actual rendering. After installation, a no-contact
hardware verification waited **20.708 seconds** with sensor/panel-FOD/touch-FOD
`1/0/1`, no results and a continuously fresh lease. Cancellation restored
`0/0/0` and removed the lease. The saved print and all three PAM files remained
unchanged; the existing SPU owner was preserved. The new extension still needs a
logout/password login to replace GNOME's cached v9 module before physical
icon/capture testing. No new enrollment is required.

Package SHA-256 values:

- libfprint gts9u45: `3aaebc51064929d0697eeb76c6b985ae5f8fe700b86f8a399a01f3cea111a786`.
- Device 2.41: `4c26f297394c865555e261472ea1b37e446bc1622a9297551e3143b435f84867`.

This does **not** yet supply an overlay in GDM's separate initial-login greeter,
coordinate the on-screen keyboard with touch suppression, add near-sensor
error text, or replace the diagnostic SPU owner with production boot handling.
Use the password for the initial login; then test the icon in Companion and
the session lock screen. No reboot or SPU-owner restart is needed or performed.

## Keyboard inhibition and GDM integration (2026-09-03)

The user confirmed that the resting-icon/touch-to-light change works; the
running **v10 ACTIVE** was verified before proceeding. **gts9u46 + device 2.42 /
overlay 11** now implement the next integration checkpoint. The package requires
at least driver gts9u46: an older driver would hide the icon but still suppress
keyboard touches, which is not a valid partial upgrade.

### Availability and keyboard safety

Shell reserves the keyboard's final rectangle as soon as it starts showing,
and throughout its hide animation. Geometry uses the same applied monitor
transform as the target; it never moves the target away from the physical
sensor. When the keyboard overlaps, the target and nearby feedback are hidden.

A small root system-bus service, `ubuntu-gts9u-fingerprint-ui`, publishes a
two-second availability lease under `/run/gts9u-fingerprint-ui/ready`. It accepts
`Pulse(sessionId, available)` only when the sender UID belongs to the requested
active local graphical session on seat0, including GDM's greeter. It checks
logind again while the lease is live and drops it on expiry, session change,
or the publishing bus connection closing. NameOwnerChanged is accepted only
from the bus daemon. Inactive Shell sessions do not send pulses. The service
cannot access hardware, templates, PAM or authentication results; its only
effect is allowing/pausing optical capture. Root is not an implicit exception
to the active-session check. Active-user applications could also pause capture;
this channel is an availability aid, never an authentication authority.

The driver publishes its operation status independently so the UI can resume
a paused operation. Without a valid ready lease it turns **both panel HBM and
Goodix FOD off**, preserving the normal touchscreen. When the UI becomes ready,
it re-enables contact detection and seeds the contact sequence/latch before
waiting again. Missing/unloaded Shell integration deliberately leaves capture
paused; password authentication is untouched. Cancellation and the existing
action timeout remain in force. A secure capture already executing synchronously
must return before the driver can process another pause; this update does not
make the TA call itself asynchronous.

### GDM and error feedback

The extension declares the `gdm` session mode. A separate vendor keyfile in
`/usr/share/gdm/dconf/91-gts9u-fingerprint` enables just this system extension
for the greeter. Ubuntu's existing `generate-config` recompiles the existing
profile/defaults; no GDM restart, logout, replacement profile or PAM edits are
performed by the package. Reading the effective GDM settings confirmed the
fingerprint extension enabled and `disable-user-extensions=false`. This follows
the installed Ubuntu GDM layout, together with GNOME's documented
[extension defaults](https://help.gnome.org/system-admin-guide/extensions-enable.html)
and [greeter dconf configuration](https://help.gnome.org/system-admin-guide/login-logo.html).

The overlay also mirrors native, localized `gdm-fingerprint` error messages
above the physical target for four seconds. It observes the native verifier's
`show-message` signal; it never answers or completes authentication, and ignores
password messages. Text follows the displayed UI orientation and disappears
when the keyboard covers the sensor or the native prompt is destroyed.

### Validation and next physical checkpoint

- **136 C cases** pass with UBSan, plus 75 keyboard geometry, 12 mocked overlay
  transition, five native-feedback observation, eight broker policy, 36 sensor
  geometry, 13 visual lease, seven auth recovery and 16 Companion tests.
- ARM64 compilation passed without warnings. Both packages were installed,
  with unchanged saved-print/PAM checks and the same live SPU and GDM processes.
- A bounded no-contact hardware test exercised missing UI, blocked UI, ready UI,
  keyboard appearing/dismissed, heartbeat expiry/restoration and client
  disconnection. Every paused state was sensor/panel-FOD/touch-FOD **1/0/0**;
  every ready state **1/0/1**. No verification result or HBM was produced.
  Cancellation restored **0/0/0** and removed the operation lease. A root caller
  could not impersonate the active user; a user caller supplying a different
  session was rejected. The root-owned lease was readable by the ordinary user.
- The first probe was interrupted by a contact release/new press at the sensor,
  which correctly enabled HBM. After coordination with the user, the complete
  no-contact sequence above passed. This is distinct from an actual keyboard
  or greeter rendering test.

Installed SHA-256:

- libfprint gts9u46: `11051657db1ece983e8aafd7ba66928636b6960d8ca81610470f6657d76ecdcc`.
- Device 2.42: `3a2879ce06ecfef95087a14aec8ec049034f32f0e1081281d1bdf7bd2f5fbf80`.

The running user Shell still caches v10 until a **logout/login**, not just a
screen lock. Physical validation must check the new GDM icon/recognition,
portrait keyboard typing at the former overlap, return of the icon after
dismissing the keyboard, and wrong-finger feedback. Password remains the
fallback. Do not call those paths proven based only on the broker probe.

After that checkpoint: back up the existing print and validate registration,
retry feedback, cancellation, removal/re-registration and recognition using
GNOME Settings from scratch. The final separate task is production SPU startup
and a controlled Ubuntu reboot; the diagnostic DMA/listener owner is still
required and must not be restarted independently. The overall estimate remains
approximately **94%**, pending real UI and cold-start validation.

## Authentication keyboard and passive overlay (2026-09-03)

The user physically validated **GDM fingerprint login**, hiding the portrait
target when the native keyboard covers it, and successful fingerprint use after
dismissing that keyboard. Two regressions remain: one GDM login left the desktop
unresponsive to touch, and the lock-screen keyboard did not open automatically
without the cover unless accessibility forced it on.

Read-only inspection after the report found sensor power, panel FOD and touch
FOD all zero, no operation lease, zero active multitouch slots and a hidden
overlay. The active user Shell held the touch device; the inactive GDM Shell
did not. No relevant touch-controller or extension exception was found in the
examined interval. **This does not establish the cause of the intermittent
failure.** The user subsequently confirmed that multi-finger gestures still
worked while single-finger touches did not. A passive touch-only observation
received 1,462 frames; disabling the overlay and briefly switching away from
the graphical VT and back did not restore single touch. All physical touch
slots were idle afterward, and the pen was not in proximity. With the user's
approval, a normal logout/login recovered single touch. **This demonstrates
recovery after restarting GNOME, not a permanent fix or the triggering cause.**
No controller reset, Ubuntu reboot, Android boot, SPU restart or auth-grab removal
was performed.

The installed Ubuntu GNOME 46 KeyboardManager requires both seat touch mode and
a last-device touchscreen hint for automatic OSK activation. Goodix consumes
fingerprint contacts before Mutter, so a fingerprint touch cannot provide that
hint. The initial **device 2.43 / overlay 12** live diagnostic also found
`touchMode=false` and `physicalKeyboard=false` despite the attached cover being
present in sysfs. A compositor-only inventory is insufficient when Companion
grabs/forwards the cover. **Device 2.44 / overlay 13** therefore adds a narrowly
scoped fallback to the existing native keyboard policy:

- Only an active local authentication screen on the tablet's recognized panel
  without a physical typing keyboard gets the additional enable predicate.
  It supplements the read in KeyboardManager's own private Settings instance;
  it never writes the accessibility preference or changes the shared Clutter
  seat. Native automatic touch behavior and explicit accessibility remain intact.
- Physical typing capabilities are read from sysfs, excluding only Companion's
  identified permanent forwarding device. Power/lid keys are not keyboards;
  Bluetooth keyboards are not excluded merely for using virtual UHID paths.
  Unknown physical-device metadata does not force a keyboard. The complete
  kernel inventory is refreshed on device events and once per second, including
  real keyboards that Mutter may not expose in its own device list.
- An already-focused text entry receives one native keyboard focus refresh on
  activation. Polling never repeatedly opens an intentionally dismissed OSK.
  Seat handoff, keyboard attachment and extension disable remove the fallback;
  native authentication is neither answered nor modified.
- A native keyboard API error restores the original hint and logs once without
  stopping the fingerprint panel poll or availability lease.

The fingerprint target is now **non-reactive** and excluded from the Shell
input region, just like its shade and feedback. Goodix remains responsible for
consuming sensor contacts. Showing the target no longer closes Quick Settings
or the overview. These are defensive input-isolation changes, **not a proven
fix for the reported whole-screen touch failure**.

A read-only `GetDiagnostics` method on the existing overlay session-bus object
reports session/lock state, native modal count, touch mode, physical-keyboard
detection, OSK state and overlay visibility/reactivity. It exposes no entry text,
finger images, templates, credentials or authentication answers. While the
failure is present, collect this snapshot together with touch slots, FOD flags
and the journal before logging out:

```sh
gdbus call --session --dest io.github.agcarbajo.Gts9uFingerprintOverlay \
  --object-path /io/github/agcarbajo/Gts9uFingerprintOverlay \
  --method io.github.agcarbajo.Gts9uFingerprintOverlay.GetDiagnostics
```

Validation: 48 keyboard policy/lifecycle checks; existing 75 overlap, 36 geometry,
13 visual lease, seven cancellation recovery, 12 overlay transition, five
feedback, eight broker and 16 Companion tests pass. Additional checks cover the
passive target, absence of menu/overview mutations, diagnostics and keyboard
failure isolation, plus five kernel-inventory/hotplug paths. A standalone GJS
probe on the tablet verified required Clutter APIs, real input capability parsing
(one attached physical keyboard), policy activation/restoration on a real
Gio.Settings object and unchanged stored preference. These are **not live GNOME
rendering tests**.

Device 2.44 SHA-256:
`c0df8e6f0e2cbfa503d3875ed611dae0556322ce377d0f1d14265948b906adcf`.
The driver remains gts9u46. A fresh Shell via logout/login is required to load
overlay 13. Deployment verified unchanged saved print/PAM files and preserved
SPU/GDM/Shell processes. The user then authorized a fresh graphical session;
the new GDM Shell reports **v13**, an active greeter session, **physical keyboard
present**, no policy error and a non-reactive hidden target while idle. The
next physical test is automatic native keyboard opening without
the cover, manual dismissal/return of fingerprint, and repeated GDM logins with
ordinary desktop touch afterward. Preserve a failing session for diagnostics.
The approximately **94%** estimate is unchanged until these regressions and
the native Settings/production-startup checkpoints are validated.

## Native UI validation and targetless keyboard events (2026-09-03)

The user reports that the v13 integration now works well. The corresponding
journal shows **four secure matches and five normal non-matches**, including
two successful fingerprint GDM logins. It also records native keyboard fallback
activation/deactivation and reader inhibition/resumption around UI availability.
At the final desktop snapshot there was no modal grab, keyboard-policy failure,
visible target, operation lease or active sensor/panel/touch FOD state. The
original SPU owner remained alive and no system service was failed.

One additional GNOME exception appeared during those otherwise successful tests:
`Argument descendant may not be null`, from KeyboardManager `maybeHandleEvent`
at `keyboard.js:1165`, called by native modal and unlock dialogs. The installed
GNOME implementation calls `keyboardBox.contains(actor)` without handling a
null result from `stage.get_event_actor(event)`. This is a confirmed exception
path, **not proof of the cause of the earlier intermittent single-touch failure**.

**Device 2.45 / overlay 14** adds a reversible guard around that native keyboard
method. With an existing keyboard but no event actor, it returns **not handled**
so normal event propagation continues. Events with real targets retain the
original handler, including extended keys; unrelated errors still propagate.
It neither completes authentication nor clears grabs or injects input.
`GetDiagnostics` gains a counter of targetless keyboard events. Ten regression
cases cover the null-target failure, normal/extended-key dispatch, no-keyboard
early return, unrelated failures and restoration/ownership of the method.
All earlier geometry, UI-policy, broker and Companion tests still pass.

Device 2.45 SHA-256:
`3365084d76c144097f1dd516af7ec9eaaa3969360388ca26c2d24a1f7e3c673f`.
The package is installed without restarting the user's working session; overlay
14 loads on the next fresh Shell. The current successful physical tests exercised
v13, **not the new guard**. Stored print, PAM, SPU owner and graphical processes
are preserved by deployment checks.

The engineering estimate advances to approximately **95%** with the physical UI
confirmation. Remaining checkpoints are native GNOME Settings enrollment from
scratch, validation of the guard and continued touch stability, and safe
production SPU startup followed by a controlled Ubuntu-only reboot. Do not call
the feature boot-independent while the secure DMA/listener owner is transient.

## Native enrollment and independent matching identities (2026-09-03)

The user successfully enrolled a second finger through GNOME Settings. The
journal confirms 17 accepted samples, 100% coverage, a successful EnrollFinal
and a saved 844,630-byte encrypted payload. The previous 848,262-byte payload
remains unchanged. Lock-screen identification then failed before arming with
`EL721 gallery has mixed identities or is too large`.

This was a driver bug, not a missing GNOME overlay. Each enrollment deliberately
uses a separately generated, persisted identity authenticated with the encrypted
print. The old matcher required every gallery entry to have the same identity
and concatenated their ciphertexts into one IdentifyInit request. That cannot
work for independently enrolled prints: IdentifyInit accepts only one identity.
Read-only metadata inspection confirmed two different identities and secure
slots 3 and 2. No identity or biometric bytes were logged or published.

**libfprint gts9u47** validates all supplied records, then imports and verifies
each print independently using its original identity and ciphertext. Only an
explicit secure no-match plus successful IdentifyFinal advances to the next
entry. A match is attributed exclusively to the currently loaded entry, never
to the first gallery print with the same slot. This also avoids ambiguity when
different fingers map to the same one of the four secure slot numbers.

The next candidate gets a fresh secure capture, not a reused image or a fabricated
match. With the finger still down, the already-settled light remains on and the
driver yields before capturing again. Cancellation, contact release, UI
inhibition and watchdog checks run between candidates. If the finger lifts,
the remaining candidate waits for a new contact. Only one terminal result is
reported to libfprint: success for a securely matched supplied print, normal
non-match after exhausting the gallery, or an unchanged quality retry/error.
Encrypted records, enrollment identities and PAM configuration are not migrated
or rewritten. Matching several stored fingers can require a longer held touch.

Validation includes nine new offline tests for independent identity/payload
lifetime, slot collisions, ten synthetic entries exceeding the aggregate TA
packet size, sticky exhaustion, invalid data, cleanup, held/released contacts
and cleared illumination deadlines. These and the preceding 136 C checks pass
under UBSan; the ARM64 package builds successfully. Synthetic ten-print tests
are not a claim of physical ten-finger validation.

Package SHA-256:
`526a5082ddbb0ef13c68642e2050ada7b52516cd0d7649d581930a5fb09bfb98`.
Deployment backed up both prints and verified them byte-for-byte afterward,
with unchanged PAM, SPU owner, GDM and user Shell. No reboot or logout occurred.
Bounded live fprintd tests successfully armed the newly enrolled finger, the
original finger and `any` mode, with a visible passive target, HBM off before
contact, and all hardware flags/operation lease cleared on cancellation.
Physical matching against the new two-print gallery remains the next user test.

The estimate remains approximately **95%** pending that validation and the
remaining production-startup/stability checkpoints. Native enrollment is now
confirmed; full cold-start independence is still not claimed.

## Automatic secure startup: first Ubuntu boot (2026-09-03)

The user confirmed native login with the newly registered finger after loading
overlay 14, followed by working ordinary single-finger desktop input. The
journal confirms secure matching of the second candidate, without a mixed-gallery
error. This closes the immediate v14 fresh-session checkpoint, not a statistical
proof that the earlier intermittent input issue cannot recur.

**Device 2.46** introduces `ubuntu-gts9u-fingerprint-secure.service`, a
boot-lifetime supervisor and a separately compiled native secure owner. It:

- Checks hashes of the owner's existing 23-file firmware/runtime set and
  requires Ubuntu-local NVM directories, rejecting Android-mounted storage.
  Proprietary binaries and NVM contents are not included in the public package.
- Loads the matching signed SPSS IRQ module and transport modules, then starts
  `sec_nvm` and `spdaemon` in the measured order. No boot image or DTB changes.
- Registers the global SPL listener **before** Keymaster negotiation, the
  20-KiB secure DMA binding, configuration and authenticated HwVault restore.
  Only actual cache acknowledgement produces readiness. The optional
  SetVersion status is handled as in the validated stock sequence; Configure
  and credential restoration must succeed.
- Gives fprintd a bounded readiness prerequisite with a five-second renewable
  root-owned lease. Daemon exit, observed SPSS state loss or initialization
  failure withdraws readiness. Password/PAM configuration is unchanged.
- Rejects duplicate initialization and repeat attempts in the same boot,
  disables automatic restart and refuses manual service stop. Once a DMA
  address may have reached secure world, even an uncertain failure retains the
  owner rather than freeing its memory and retrying.

The service uses the normal full-OS shutdown path, as the previously validated
transient owner did. It does **not** attempt a secure subsystem restart. It also
does not use `SurviveFinalKillSignal`/the `@argv` mechanism: upstream documents
that mechanism for initrd infrastructure, not daemons running from the root
filesystem ([systemd shutdown guidance](https://systemd.io/ROOT_STORAGE_DAEMONS/)).
The IRQ bridge still lacks full SSR notification; polling remoteproc state is
not a guarantee of observing a rapid reset/recovery cycle. The existing
device-specific static shared-heap compatibility runtime is retained and
hash-checked, not replaced by or advertised as a generic StrongBox implementation.

Fifteen offline tests cover lease validity/expiry, ownership and symlink guards,
duplicate attempts, read-only checks, bounded failure, service lifetime policy
and source-level protocol ordering/DMA-retention contracts. These are not
hardware failure-injection tests. The native ARM64 build and systemd unit
validation pass. The IRQ module is byte-identical to the already tested signed
build. Device package SHA-256:
`74cc0b40c65b83362bbe4459f32c085c76a9b9d06780aaf16eb9c98bdff3a66e`.

Deployment backed up both enrolled prints, device-local Gatekeeper state and
Ubuntu NVM. Byte comparisons and checksums confirmed that the prints,
Gatekeeper state, PAM and active Ubuntu boot partition were unchanged. The
existing secure owner was not restarted or killed during installation.

With user authorization, a **normal Ubuntu-only reboot** then completed.
The service started automatically, announced SPSS applications ready after
about six seconds and authenticated secure-cache readiness one second later.
The new boot has no failed system units. fprintd subsequently completed Claim
and Release without manual secure initialization, leaving sensor power, panel
HBM and touch FOD disabled. Both saved prints, Gatekeeper state, PAM and the
boot partition again compare unchanged after reboot.

The user then confirmed both fingerprints in the requested post-boot and
resume tests. The journal records a secure new-print match at 03:34:53, an
actual suspend/resume at 03:35:09–11, and old-print matches at 03:35:17 and
03:35:40. The native owner and both SPSS daemons remained the same processes.
All sensor/FOD flags returned to zero and there were no failed system units.
The final package was rebuilt without a generated Python test cache; the
runtime code did not change, and reinstalling it preserved both prints and
the running secure owner/Shell. Test imports and packaging now exclude caches.

The approximate **98%** assessment counts automatic boot initialization and
this physical confirmation, not long-run stability or general crash-recovery
safety. Fresh-image builders must still provide the
validated private runtime at the manifest's documented location; this feature
does not fetch or copy Android credentials or user biometric data.
